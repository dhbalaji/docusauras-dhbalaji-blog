2. **Fundamental**: With time the trend changes, for instance we do not walk everywhere. We use transportation. The transportation used to be horses, bicycles, cars & electric vehicles. The fundamental idea is to get work done with right option available. 

3. **Advanced**: Advanced category refers to the niche area which only professionals get to work with. You may call it advanced level engineering problems.
