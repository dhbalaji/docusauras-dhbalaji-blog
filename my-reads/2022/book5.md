Hey there, great men say that you should make money while you sleep. If you agree with that saying then you should check the stock market or start your own business which can run without your presence. Historically many men & women have made a good sum of money in the long term by investing in the right stock. Hey, the key to remember is **Right stock**. How do you know if you have chosen the right stock? The answer lies in the fundamental analysis of the stock. 

When I was at the book, my eyes fell on the books titled **Fundamental analysis of shares** by Ankit Gala & Khusboo Gala. I was interested in the book because I too wanted to stay invested in stocks.

## About the authors

When you are choosing a subject that is about money, it's better to listen to the experts. Both authors have strong financial backgrounds and they have an understanding of the mindset of the retail investor.

In the preface, they mention that 90% of retail investors lose money in the stock market. This is because retail investors generally do little to no research about the stock. They listen to friends, and stock picks or tell a comfortable lie to themselves. The authors have given their best shot at breaking this practice by writing concisely about fundamental analysis.

## Top 3 ideas from the book

This book is not about ideas, it's about technical terms and definitions. Quoting a few of them.
