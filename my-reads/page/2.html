<p>I have been reading books about all things that matter in life. This is the first book about the most important place on earth &quot;The Home&quot;. Each one&#x27;s home is unique and I am going to talk about this book from a working-class person living in India.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home is a place for rest &amp; focus. Find alignment between purpose &amp; possession in life.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="about-the-author">About the author<a href="#about-the-author" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About the author" title="Direct link to About the author" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The author is a minimalist guru and a staunch advocate of minimalism. If you are going to search for the word minimalist on any search engine or social media platform, you might run into the works of Joshua Becker. He has written multiple books on the topic of minimalism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goals shape us, goals change us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the ideas from his previous books which I follow meticulously is <code>remove duplicates</code>. Have 2 towels instead of 5. Wash the blankets and use them within the same day. You do not need to maintain multiple blankets.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="why-minimalism">Why minimalism<a href="#why-minimalism" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why minimalism" title="Direct link to Why minimalism" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Prioritize extra time in hand and extra money in your pocket over extra things in the closet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted you to observe the people around you. Some of them are super focussed on the things they do and deterministic about the things they own. While a vast majority of them are otherwise. If you lift your head and observe some legendary people like Steve Jobs &amp; Mahatma Gandhi, they were leading a minimalist life. They were spearheaded about the mission of their life. Both Steve Jobs &amp; Gandhi were not popular because they wore fancy dresses/clothing most of the time. They did not own fancy homes but the outcome of their work and the value they brought to the world is immeasurable.</p>
<p>In success literature, it&#x27;s a trend to observe and reverse engineer the qualities of successful people or reverse the trend which is followed by the masses. In this context <code>minimalism</code> has hit a niche market and there is a good amount of education, adoption, and evangelism available out there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are bound by home instead of being freed by home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#x27;s answer the <code>why</code>, Minimalism is a philosophy so it&#x27;s hard to punch in a scientific definition of minimalism. Minimalism is about focusing on things that matter to you and your goal in life. A minimalist tries to turn his surroundings, tools, and thoughts toward the main goal in life.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s observe Steve Jobs, he believed in good design. According to Jobs, design is not how it looks but how it works. His car, dress, office, products, and entire life were obsessively driven by design instead of being missold to random ideas or whims of the market. Nevertheless, he achieved great things in life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reimagine the environment around the goals in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book is written around the topic of &quot;Home&quot;. The author prescribes how to approach each room as a minimalist. Of course, if you were to follow this book. You might expect trouble from your family or roommates and the author has written about that too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your house does not have a basement, then your bed storage is your basement.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="stuff-problem">Stuff problem<a href="#stuff-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stuff problem" title="Direct link to Stuff problem" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Once in a while, Indian moms yell at their children for bringing home something useless. But the child feels it&#x27;s the best thing they could buy in their life. As a grown-up adult, I purchased a few things which I am not proud of like expensive home gym equipment which was not used at all. My mom complained right on the day of purchase and even showed me alternates like running or using body weight. Let&#x27;s say I did not have a mom and I go binge shopping. I would be left with 10 items sitting on the floor because they did not have a shelf to sit on all the time. My room would turn into a cave with all sorts of things that I do not use. That&#x27;s exactly what the author calls out as a stuff problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have nice things to impress your friends, then you got the wrong friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People with stuff problems have trouble with shifting homes, spending more time on the upkeep and lastly, they cannot say where their things are. They keep misplacing things and spend a lot of time searching for them. Simple things like walking in the dark are not easy because they have stuff sitting on the floor. I have personally seen some Indian homes where the guests can clearly call out as a mess. Some guests would even give advice like &quot;why don&#x27;t you clear the textbooks from school which are stacked up on the floor in a corner of the room?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing on the floor except 4 pieces of furniture per room.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="minimalism-dividend">Minimalism dividend<a href="#minimalism-dividend" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Minimalism dividend" title="Direct link to Minimalism dividend" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>If you were given a chance to go back in time and were given a full refund for exchanging all the things you emotionally bought, how would more extra cash you would have? You would definitely have more money today. Imagine if you had invested correctly instead of buying things, that investment would have given you dividends.</p>
<p>If the above advice sounds too strict, hear it out. As a minimalist, you will buy things and some of your purchases might end up as clutter. But compared to a normal soul who is spending on things and loading his house with 30,000 items, you are doing much better.</p>
<p>Do not go by what advertisers call it out as trend-like colors to wear this summer etc. By not falling into consumerism, you avoid debts. This is an advantage of being a minimalist and this is what the author calls a &quot;Minimalism Dividend&quot; just like stock dividends.</p>

<p>Refusal to buy things that waste money and take up clutter pays you minimalist dividends.</p>

<p>Most of us have done this. Let&#x27;s say you purchased a flower vase thinking you would decorate it with beautiful flowers once a week. But as time goes by, the flower&#x27;s cost and upkeep make you wonder if it&#x27;s worth it. In that case, you accept the defeat and pack the vase and relocate the vase from display to a box in the basement. The Indian version is &quot;top shelf of the room or below the bed&quot;. That&#x27;s it, you forget and move on but that item is still sitting somewhere and adding to the clutter count.</p>
<p>Instead, the author recommends you donate or sell it at a garage sale. The Indian equivalent of a garage sale is <code>olx</code>. Either use the item or discard it. Before you discard it, run it through a small checklist like if your family member would get angry, when did you last use it? etc.</p>

<p>At the shopping mall or supermarket, the things we buy fall into 2 categories. They are <code>Consumables</code> &amp; <code>Durables</code>. The <code>Consumables</code> are food items, natural flowers, etc. The <code>Durables</code> are books, toys, and furniture. The author recommends buying consumables instead of durables as the consumables are spent for experiences but later bought for future use.</p>
<p>I like what the author says. Sometimes the books we do not start reading the books we read but we hold it thinking we will read them someday. The same with the DSLR camera which we bought. The authors advocate renting durables.</p>
<p>Having said that it&#x27;s a noble idea to vote for consumables but not all consumables are safe. What if someone buys an addictive substance because he is not going to spend on durable? It&#x27;s a possibility.</p>
<p>The Indian version would be to ask your mom/spouse to supervise the money for you. It works most of the time.</p>

<p>For investments, contact an advisor. For spending, you need a regulator.</p>

<p>Overall the book is an intermediate-level read where the reader is supposed to read and make changes not just to himself but to the lifestyle of the family. The goals of each room and the refusal to buy things that do not bring value or simply clutter are absolutely great ideas to explore at a young age.</p>
<p>If you are someone who walks with a plan, integrates parts of your life by design, and is willing to be counter-cultured, this book is for you. I will leave you with a quote from the book which I believe is so true.</p>

<p>The first day of 2023 was spent on the couch with this book titled &quot;48-hour start-up formula, from idea to launch in 1 weekend by Fraser Doherty MBE&quot; in my hand.</p>
<p>The book falls in the <code>Business</code> genre. This genre is notorious for being tough to read, having way too theoretical ideas, beating the drum aka success literature, etc without any actionable items or take away for audiences. This book differs from the tough business books by staying up to date with the current omnichannel market strategy.</p>

<p>The author describes his childhood vividly in the book, He was an enthusiastic child who wants to make money by selling very early as a school-going kid. In this process, he learns everything practically.</p>
<p>Over the period, he makes his success mark with a product called <code>SuperJam</code> which is a product developed with his talented grandma in their kitchen and sold door to door in the initial days. Later the product is put on supermarket shelves and it goes on to make a successful international brand.</p>
<p>The author is well qualified to write a book on startups and launching products. Given his practical learning, the author refrains from ideas that lead to analysis paralysis.</p>

<p>While finding the perfect idea for our startup, we were told to focus on something unique and not another copy product. But in reality, the real world is full of copy products which are a little different here and there. Maybe better, faster, cheaper, etc.</p>
<p>When there is no USP, we have to come to terms with people who are going to copy your product in parts or as a whole. In that case, the story behind the product is unique to each product and can be a strong anchor point in the customer&#x27;s mind.</p>

<p>The first mover advantage is great but the first mover has to experiment a lot with his time and money. He has to have a research team to learn about the market. After all this hard work, the chances of the first mover&#x27;s success are very less compared to the guy who learned from a successful product, made reasonable changes, and sold it.</p>
<p>Someone who starts second has a 75% less chance of failing. This is a perfect example of the commodities/items at the supermarket.</p>

<p>The author discusses the 4P while developing an idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>P - Product, what am I selling</li>
<li>P - Promotion, how will I let the world know that the product exists</li>
<li>P - Place, where will my customers find me</li>
<li>P - Price, at what price can I get customers and make a profit</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to pricing, the improvised products take the middle road. They choose to place the price somewhere between the minimum and maximum. This technique is risky because the competition is intense and everyone is doing the same. The companies in the middle are on the decline. However, the space at the minimum and maximum has less competition and more profits.</p>
<p>For instance, Uber, Ryan Air, and Amazon are capturing low-end markets. Companies like Apple and Tesla are capturing high-end markets.</p>

<p>Well, I agree with the ideas in the book. But planning something new minute by minute to be executed on a weekend comes at a cost. It means no time for weekend chores and I bet someone will distract us over the weekend unless you do all of this sitting in a private office.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes the importance of focused work and being in a great moment. Only through focus, the author tells with conviction that you can build your startup in 48 hours</p>

<p>Written in 2013, a book on adaptive web design and how to do it with progressive enhancement. The title of the book might sound mouth full but let&#x27;s look into it in parts.</p>
<p>Adaptive web design is the elder kin of responsive web design (RWD), Read more about <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/adaptive-design-vs-responsive-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RWD vs Adaptive web design</a>. In the context of the book, the book is a how-to literature on how to do adaptive web design. The main technique that was discussed was `progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement - the gold standard of how to approach the web. It&#x27;s aimed at crafting experiences that serve the users by giving them access to content without technological restrictions.</p>
<p>Progressive enhancement relies on fault tolerance. A system can operate when it encounters an unexpected error.</p>
<p>Browsers play by the rules of fault tolerance and ignore anything they did not understand. Fault tolerance has been a part of HTML and CSS since the beginning. They are forever forward-compatible.</p>
<p>We all have special needs, and progressive enhancement wins.</p>

<p>HTML and CSS are ideal tools for progressive enhancement. Javascript is not fault-tolerant, it breaks with an error. If the user turns off Javascript, the user is shown a blank white screen most of the time.</p>
<p>An ideal developer will have to check before executing JS and JS APIs.</p>

<p>A light read written in 2013. The world has moved towards working and testing apps on browsers with major browser share. The book reminds us of the importance of building sites/apps for past and upcoming technologies. After a long time, I was able to weigh in progressive enhancement vs graceful degradation. Overall an interesting light read.</p>

<li>The personas of the disabled people</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, books categorize people with disability and stop there. But the authors take this issue description in a well-recognized technical language called <code>Personas</code>. The persona description and images of the users illustrate to the readers about the user. This is important because all our lives we are not exposed to disabled people to a major degree.</p>

<p>Ability + Barrier = Disability</p>

<p>The barrier is to be broken with technology. For example, if a user has bad vision then we need to help them consume our content with a screen magnifier or screen reader. Web content should be accessible to the disabled audience</p>

<p>Design is a subjective topic and point of debate in several corporate meetings. The debate happens due to <code>Cognitive Dissonance</code>, <code>exposure effect</code> &amp; <code>consistency bias</code>. But wait, the last 3 terms are common in the design world and are universal to design. This book does not talk about how to design an app but this book helps you take an insider view of design, processes, and patterns in design.</p>

<p>As I am a software developer, here are a few topics that I liked from the book</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects and environments should be designed to be used without modification, by as many people as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful products typically follow four stages of creation: requirements, design, development, and testing. All products progress sequentially through the basic stages of creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requirements - gathered through market research, customer feedback, etc. Design requirements are derived from direct knowledge or experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design - the stage where design requirements are translated into a form that yields a set of specifications. Excellent design is usually accomplished through careful research of existing or analogous solutions, ample use of prototyping, and many iterations of trying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development - the development stage is where design specifications are transformed into an actual product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing - The stage where the product is tested to ensure that it meets design requirements and specifications and will be accepted by the target audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feedback loop - A relationship between variables in a system where the consequences of event feedback into the system as input, modifying the event in the future. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. When reactions loop back to affect themselves, a feedback loop is created.</p>
<p>Positive feedback amplifies output, resulting in growth. Negative feedback dampens output, stabilizing the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immersion - A state of mental focus so intense that awareness of the real world is lost, generally resulting in a feeling of joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p>When perceptual and cognitive systems are under-taxed, people become apathetic and bored. If they are over-taxed, people become stressed and frustrated. Immersion occurs when perceptual and cognitive systems are challenged at near capacity without being exceeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation - A technique for preventing unintended actions by requiring verification of the actions before they are performed. Confirmations are used to prevent a class of errors called slips. Confirmations slow task performance and should be reserved for use with critical and irreversible operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A wonderful book to get an introduction to the world of design. The knowledge of universal design is going to impact all walks of your life, for instance, you won&#x27;t look at <code>Apple Store</code> as a mere structure. The Apple store is a classic example of Orientation Sensitivity and threat detection.</p>

<p>Hey there, great men say that you should make money while you sleep. If you agree with that saying then you should check the stock market or start your own business which can run without your presence. Historically many men &amp; women have made a good sum of money in the long term by investing in the right stock. Hey, the key to remember is <strong>Right stock</strong>. How do you know if you have chosen the right stock? The answer lies in the fundamental analysis of the stock.</p>
<p>When I was at the book, my eyes fell on the books titled <strong>Fundamental analysis of shares</strong> by Ankit Gala &amp; Khusboo Gala. I was interested in the book because I too wanted to stay invested in stocks.</p>

<p>When you are choosing a subject that is about money, it&#x27;s better to listen to the experts. Both authors have strong financial backgrounds and they have an understanding of the mindset of the retail investor.</p>
<p>In the preface, they mention that 90% of retail investors lose money in the stock market. This is because retail investors generally do little to no research about the stock. They listen to friends, and stock picks or tell a comfortable lie to themselves. The authors have given their best shot at breaking this practice by writing concisely about fundamental analysis.</p>

<p>Hi, we are here discussing another health-related book. You may ask, why another health-related book? thanks to book discovery that happened through the previous read. The previous book had mentioned another health book for programmers so I picked this book titled <strong>Hackers Diet by John Walker</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="about-the-author">About the author<a href="#about-the-author" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to About the author" title="Direct link to About the author" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The general trend of a health author profile looks like a nutritionist, sports hero, chef, or someone with a great body. Here we have an author who was fat most of his life. The author is the founder of AutoDesk, the AutoCAD software company and he is wondering about his success at work but failure at shedding his weight.</p>
<p>The author thought that fat was a problem to be solved and not a burden to withstand. Once he solved his weight problem, he is sharing the tools with us so that we live long and prosper.</p>
<p>The author has great expectations for the readers or his audience who want to lose weight. The audience should have</p>
<ul>
<li>An eye firmly fixed on the goal</li>
<li>Will power</li>
<li>A high tolerance for pain</li>
</ul>
<p>The author throws light on the word hacker. <code>Hacker is a person who derives joy from discovering ways to circumvent limitations.</code></p>

<p>No prizes for guessing the theme of the book, i.e. How can I lose weight?</p>
<p>The author says &quot;Eat less food than your body burns&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s a hypothetical concept that tells when you should start eating and when to stop. This concept is based on the fact that <strong>if people did not eat except when their bodies needed food, nobody would be overweight</strong>. Let hunger tell us the time when we should eat instead of the convention like meeting friends or family dinner etc.</p>
<p>For the eat watch to work, the food you eat needs to give feedback to the body to stop eating. Slim people have this built-in eat watch which tells <code>enough already</code> but in others, that circuit is broken.</p>
<p>To control weight, you need to eat the right amount of food for the rest of your life. This requires motivation and manipulation. Motivation comes from willpower. Manipulation is the technique you use to deceive yourself, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s half past 9 pm, let&#x27;s exercise tomorrow. To control manipulation, we need empowerment.</p>
<p>If weight is managed rightly, you are about to partake of a new and rich part of the human experience, the exultation of living in a healthy animal body.</p>

<p>There are 3 parts to make a note of while losing weight</p>
<ul>
<li>What we put into the body in calories, we can control this</li>
<li>What amount of input calories get burnt in calories</li>
<li>What goes out of the body, we can ignore the measurement of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes approximately 7000 calories to add a kilogram of weight to your body. It&#x27;s a glorious idea to control your weight without changing the way you eat, but like so many attractive ideas, it doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t delude yourself into thinking that exercise can do the whole job. For many of us, exercising just causes us to eat that little bit more that cancels out its benefits. The calories burned by exercising, even counting the secondary effects on metabolism, can be erased by even the slightest increases in food intake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Permanent weight control requires permanent attention to what you eat. Life-long, permanent attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="benefits-of-exercise-and-meal-planning">Benefits of exercise and meal planning<a href="#benefits-of-exercise-and-meal-planning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits of exercise and meal planning" title="Direct link to Benefits of exercise and meal planning" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Exercising not only gives you more time to live, but it also makes the time you live more enjoyable. You&#x27;ll feel better, think straighter, sleep more soundly and have more capacity and endurance for everything you wish to do. Regular exercise greatly reduces the effects of altitude. As you exercise, you increase the capacity of your heart to pump blood and your lungs to replenish the oxygen it carries.</p>
<p>Meal planning for predictable calorie intake is the central management tool that closes the circle and achieves control over weight. Meal planning requires total control over not just what you eat, but also how much. Also, eat at the same time every day. Avoid eating before sleep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The faster you eat, the more you get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are steps to implement a weight control loop/feedback system</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimate calories</li>
<li>Plan meals</li>
<li>Log weight</li>
<li>Find a trend and adjust the estimation of calories</li>
<li>Repeat step 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Stress is an unavoidable consequence of living in our fast-paced high-tech culture. Stress is a primary cause of overeating and weight gain.</p>

<p>Of course, modern science is vocal about metabolic disorders which could make a person fat. The author is fixated on the idea that our body is a pure function and the system can be mathematically modeled all the time.</p>

<p>Though the book has been written 3 decades ago. The fundamental ideas are the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat in moderation</li>
<li>Deliberately starve yourself to the good life</li>
<li>Avoid packaged food despite their tall claims</li>
<li>Exercise to beat cholesterol &amp; fat</li>
<li>Use excel sheets for some good cause like tracking calories, weight, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to pick a health-related book written by an engineer who built a great company, writes about planning with excel, talks about moving averages, lots of formulas, etc then this book is for you.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/my-reads/3">The Healthy Programmer Get Fit, Feel Better and Keep Coding By Joe Kutner</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-10-20T15:30:00.000Z">October 20, 2022</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The Healthy Programmer Book Cover" src="/assets/images/the-healthy-programmer-cover-2cdb37a9ba51ff9f8e60406c1471374a.webp" width="500" height="600" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>Hey there, let&#x27;s discuss a book that explains health in a way that would captivate techies (techies here refer to people who sit before the keyboard) around the world. This book aims at refactoring your health. The book is titled &quot;The Healthy Programmer&quot;. As a programmer myself, I did not think twice before picking up this book and read this book immediately. Let me explain how this book felt in parts.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Health-related books are intended only as an informative guide for those who wish to know health-related aspects however these books should not be treated as a replacement for licensed healthcare providers. Don&#x27;t be the DIY guy trying to immunize or treat himself all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amish communities are known for their embrace of a rural lifestyle, manual labor, and a reluctance to adopt modern technology. It’s a far cry from the world of programmers, where we have to remind ourselves to get outside and walk around now and then.</p>

<p>I love to read this book because hacker slang creeps into the pages aptly. The book starts with <code>Let&#x27;s Refactor your Health</code>. That&#x27;s what most of us want anyways. Here are some of the good parts.</p>

<p>Before performing refactoring on our body, let&#x27;s perform a few unit tests like</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you lose your breath after climbing a single flight of stairs</li>
<li>Do you regularly sit for more than one hour without getting up?</li>
<li>In the last year have you experienced back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain</li>
<li>In the last week have your eyes become dry, red, or difficult to focus</li>
<li>Have you eaten until you were comfortably full more than once in the last month</li>
<li>Have you been exposed to direct sunlight for less than 10 minutes today</li>
<li>Is it uncomfortable to bend over and tie your shoes</li>
<li>Has your pant size increased significantly in the last 5 years</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s a brainer to figure out the associated risks related to each unit test. Once we identify the risk, we can plan to mitigate the risk.</p>

<p>Programmers are lifelong learners &amp; and an avatar of students. Learning and keeping ourselves up to date is indispensable. one of the best ways to enhance your ability to learn is to get some exercise. There’s also a lot of laboratory evidence showing that our brains work better when our bodies are active. In particular, they become better at remembering new concepts, ideas, and patterns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies show that doing exercise before or after learning something new can help you remember it.</p>

<p>Walking is our first guard in defense against lifestyle disease. Use the pedometer on your phone or wristband and clock 10000 steps every day. To get better results, walk often. Hitting the gym and sitting for 15 hours is not effective.</p>
<p>Walking 10000 steps in a day does not capture the intensity, instead, target the daily total of 10k steps to come from spurts of 3,000 steps in thirty minutes or 1,000 steps in ten minutes to ensure that some of your walkings are done briskly.</p>

<p>Hey there, let&#x27;s discuss an interesting short, light, and no-nonsense read from the <code>self-help</code> genre. Most self-help books try to address one or more than one broad problem in life. This book is no different in that aspect. As the title suggests, this book attempts to solve problems related to</p>
<ol>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Meaning in life</li>
</ol>

<p>A book cannot be separated from the author because it&#x27;s the author who gave its form and contents. So the author&#x27;s personality gets into the book. After reading the book, here is what I understand about the author.</p>
<p>The author is a seeker, and doer and wishes to be deterministic about what he does in life. He seems to avoid the <code>digital</code> life. He is cautious about the time drainers however he says he is not a robot and consumes entertainment.</p>
<p>Overall I like the author because his advice/tips are relevant to modern times.</p>

I know of people who would reply to Whatsapp messages once a week, they are quite ahead of normal people.</p>

<p>As an adult, we are our job. We are identified by our job and trusted by banks based on our job so we get attached or dedicated to our job and ignore the rest. Here are other important things in life.</p>

<p>Paying bills is important but there is something more to life than bills themselves.</p>
<p>Overall an interesting short, crisp read which focuses on tactics over techniques for boosting productivity and beating procrastination.</p>
<p>In most places, the author has picked and phrased the best practices and ideas from other books which helps us to remember those ideas as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, the Pomodoro timer for crushing the work in front of you, we have heard of the same idea from multiple sources.</li>
<li>Plan the next day before we hit the bed, we have heard this many times but the authors improve the idea by asking you to visualize how you would feel when you get the tasks done tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book is recommended for people who want to guard their time, build focus and improve their productivity.</p>

<p>Let me start with my favorite line from the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not own a business, you should invest in business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Financial books are the least favorite of readers because of 2 reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most financial books give orthodox advice which suits the stoics or individuals. Most normal people are not stoics, they have retired parents to take care of or they need to fund their sibling&#x27;s education.</li>
<li>Most stock market books are not written for lower-wage earning audiences. They have a point, how can someone poor invest in a portfolio of stocks? But this author gives hope to people with day jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this book is different, I am glad that I picked this read. This book is written by the author keeping their maids in mind who represent the young working-class audience.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="characters-in-the-book">Characters in the book<a href="#characters-in-the-book" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Characters in the book" title="Direct link to Characters in the book" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>There are 3 main characters in the book</p>
<ul>
<li>The financially savvy author who lives in Philipines</li>
<li>The maids who work at the author&#x27;s home</li>
<li>The company owned by the author and its clients</li>
</ul>
<p>I liked the way the maid&#x27;s persona was explained. The maids are young, working at the author&#x27;s home to make money. They are good at saving money. They send some money back home so that their family eats and lives happily. The maids are also burdened with the task of meeting financial emergencies which could arise in the family like bad health etc.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="best-ideas-from-the-book">Best ideas from the book<a href="#best-ideas-from-the-book" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Best ideas from the book" title="Direct link to Best ideas from the book" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>It&#x27;s a short book and a light read which can be read in an hour. It has 84 pages which are filled with great ideas. Here is my favorite part of the book.</p>
<p>Most books I read treat finances differently. The investment banker would not consider middle-class family problems like sending remittances back home to feed the family while writing a book on the stock market.</p>
<p>The author calls out a phrase called &quot;Feeding the civilization&quot;, which means that the breadwinner has 2 families to take care of.</p>
<ul>
<li>The family consists of the breadwinner, spouse, children &amp;</li>
<li>The family consists of breadwinner parents, breadwinner siblings, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Already the maids are working on a smaller wage but they have 2 families to take care of. So the maids are going to retire in a financially handicapped situation at old age because retirement is real. The employer whom maids have worked with and the family whom the maids raised are going to desert them when the maids are old and have no money to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>The author mentions a formula to separate your money once you get your monthly wage</p>
<ul>
<li>Tithe fund - 10% for Charity so that it creates an abundance mindset. The author is an advocate of God and religion.</li>
<li>Expense fund - 15% for Daily expenses and recreation.</li>
<li>Support fund - 30% for your family living in the village or elsewhere as a remittance so that they eat and live</li>
<li>Retirement fund - 30% for Retirement fund which sits in the share market and is built by monthly investing into the giant company stocks even during a market crisis</li>
<li>Emergency fund - 15% for the emergency fund which sits in the bank so that you do not break the retirement fund if a crisis hits</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>By investing 30% of the salary into the retirement fund for 20-plus years, the maids can retire as a millionaire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors advise the maids to avoid</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading</li>
<li>Investing in risky stocks or penny stocks</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="something-that-i-do-not-agree-with">Something that I do not agree with<a href="#something-that-i-do-not-agree-with" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Something that I do not agree with" title="Direct link to Something that I do not agree with" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>10% of the salary to God or Charity for the maids is something I do not fully agree with. It&#x27;s a good idea but I doubt if it&#x27;s actionable.</p>
<p>10% of the book goes into explaining the trading company where the author works. It makes sense only for that geographic area but it does not apply to everyone who reads the book. A hyperlink to a blog article would have helped.</p>
