# Blog Post Editing Instructions

## Objective

Edit blog posts while keeping the writer’s authentic voice intact. Ensure the post is polished, SEO-friendly, factually correct, and engaging — without losing its personality.

## Guidelines

### 1. Authentic Voice

- Preserve the original tone and style.
- Avoid over-polishing; keep natural expressions.
- Allow light humor and wit if it fits the content.

### 2. Language & Grammar

- Fix all grammar errors and typos.
- Ensure smooth sentence flow and readability.
- Avoid overly complex sentences unless they add value.

### 3. Structure

- **Intro:** Hook the reader in 2–3 sentences and set clear context.
- **Body:** Use short paragraphs, clear subheadings, and smooth transitions.
- **Summary:** Provide a concise wrap-up or witty close; include a subtle call-to-action if relevant.

### 4. SEO & Metadata

- Include primary keyword naturally in:

  - Title
  - Intro
  - 1–2 subheadings
  - Conclusion

- Add relevant meta description (≤160 characters).
- Include alt text for all images.
- Ensure front matter `date:` is accurate and in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Include **one hero image** in the front matter or at the top of the post.

### 5. Content Checks

- Verify all factual claims using credible sources.
- If unsure about accuracy, flag for review.
- Ensure the post is **more than 250 words**; expand if necessary.
- Check for logical flow and completeness of thought.
- Validate that all HTML links:

  - Are correctly formatted.
  - Do not lead to 404 or dead pages.
  - Use HTTPS where possible.

### 6. Style & Formatting

- Use active voice.
- Break text into digestible sections.
- Use **bold** for emphasis.
- Format in valid Markdown with consistent spacing and punctuation.
