Ignore it for a while and suddenly you look like the one person still writing jQuery in 2025. Among the handful of reliable sources that consistently deliver high-quality, expert insights, the Thoughtworks Technology Radar stands tall. Volume 33, in particular, has a rich collection of signals that map perfectly to modern frontend engineering. Here are the trends that caught my eye\u2014my unofficial \\"Adopt\\" list for any intermediate or above frontend engineer.\\r\\n\\r\\n## AI-Enhanced Prototyping and Design\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigners today have superpowers. Tools like **UX Pilot** and **AI Design Reviewer** act like always-available collaborators, helping generate everything from wireframes to pixel-perfect mockups. These tools also offer automated design audits, giving early warnings before a design becomes a future engineering migraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the developer side, tools like **V0** and **Bolt** allow text-based prototyping. Instead of waiting for finalized Figma files, developers can spin out interactive, throwaway prototypes in minutes. This fuels a new workflow where teams iterate rapidly on UI concepts before committing to the real build. Think of it as whiteboarding with a compiler.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Spec-Driven Development Comes of Age\\r\\n\\r\\nSpec-driven development is moving from \u201ccool experiment\u201d to \u201cserious workflow.\u201d The idea is simple: treat requirements as a versioned artifact, similar to code. Tools such as **GitHub Spec Kit** enforce this by introducing a structured flow\u2014requirements, design, and task breakdown\u2014each backed by richer orchestration and prompts. It also introduces a \u201cconstitution,\u201d a set of rules the AI helpers must always obey. When specs become first-class citizens, onboarding and collaboration get smoother, and ambiguity drops dramatically.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Agents Need Documentation Too: Enter *Agents.md*\\r\\n\\r\\nSoftware engineers long accepted README files as the source of truth. Agents are now getting the same treatment. An **Agents.md** file acts like a behavioural guidebook for AI agents, explaining their capabilities, constraints, assumptions, and intended usage. It\u2019s a simple idea but powerful for reducing unpredictability. It also improves collaboration when multiple teams depend on the same agent logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Shared Instructions with Slash Commands and Chat Modes\\r\\n\\r\\nTeams are increasingly using shared shortcuts inside their AI workflows. Slash commands like `/refactor`, `/review`, or `/prototype` help create predictable collaboration patterns. Paired with custom chat modes, teams end up with a common vocabulary for interacting with AI tools. This reduces the \u201cAI did something weird\u201d factor and introduces repeatable, deterministic workflows.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing: Faster Loops and Smarter Bots\\r\\n\\r\\nThe **Test && Commit || Revert** workflow is resurfacing as a productive pattern. The idea is brutal and effective: write code, run tests, commit only if everything passes, and automatically revert if something breaks. Tools like **Nx** make this workflow practical by running only relevant tests instead of the entire suite. Without that, you\u2019re staring at the screen waiting for tests longer than waiting for a Bangalore\u2013Hosur bus on a rainy day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAI-powered UI testing is also evolving. Playwright and Selenium now integrate with MCP-based agents that automatically author test cases, heal flaky selectors, and update broken assertions. UI tests finally feel less fragile and more self-repairing\u2014a welcome relief for any frontend engineer who has fought with a stubborn CSS selector at 2 AM.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Real-Time Human\u2013Agent Collaboration: AG-UI Protocol\\r\\n\\r\\nThe **AG-UI Protocol** is an open standard aimed at structuring communication between frontends and agents. It defines how UI components and backend agents exchange state, collaborate in real time, and suggest actions to users. As agent-driven apps become mainstream, standards like this will keep architectures from devolving into random RPC chaos.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Keeping LLMs on the Same Version: Context7\\r\\n\\r\\nLLMs often hallucinate outdated API calls because their training data is stale. **Context7** solves this by feeding models fresh, version-specific code directly from your source. This dramatically reduces the \u201cReact stopped supporting this in 2023\u201d type of errors. For fast-moving ecosystems like Next.js or Angular, this is a significant advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Feature Flags and Productivity Tools\\r\\n\\r\\nFeature flags are a necessary evil, but managing them across multiple runtimes is messy. **OpenFeature** brings a standard to how flags are defined and consumed across languages, frameworks, and platforms. It simplifies rollout strategies and makes flag management consistent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the tooling front, **pnpm** continues to prove it\u2019s the package manager npm wishes it had become. Disk usage drops, install times improve, and monorepo workflows become smoother.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tools Worth Paying Attention To\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Radar also spotlights a number of tools that feel highly relevant for frontend engineers:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Fastify** brings high-performance Node servers with a pleasant TypeScript story.\\r\\n- **LangGraph** pushes agent orchestration forward with graph-based logic flows.\\r\\n- **Nuxt** continues to mature as Vue\u2019s equivalent to Next.js, now also backed by Vercel.\\r\\n- **Tauri** lets you build desktop apps using web technologies without the Electron weight class.\\r\\n- **ADK** (Agent Development Kit) standardizes how agents are built and deployed.\\r\\n- **Assistant UI** simplifies building apps around AI assistants.\\r\\n- **Drizzle** and **Prisma** keep evolving as the most ergonomic TypeScript ORMs.\\r\\n- **OpenInference** adds observability standards for AI pipelines.\\r\\n- **Valibot** provides lightweight schema validation with tight type inference.\\r\\n- **Vercel AI SDK** is becoming the go-to for building AI-driven frontend apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Closing Thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nThoughtworks Radar Vol. 33 makes one thing clear: the frontend world is shifting toward AI-augmented workflows, spec-driven development, and structured protocols for human\u2013agent interaction. Frontends are no longer static presentation layers\u2014they\u2019re turning into dynamic negotiation tables where users and agents collaborate in real time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIgnoring these trends will leave teams struggling to catch up later. Embracing them early gives developers the advantage of speed, clarity, and leverage. The next wave of frontend innovation is already forming around standards like AG-UI and tools like Context7, and the exciting part is that we\u2019re still at the beginning of this transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore experiments soon, especially hands-on explorations with agent-driven UIs and AI-aligned development workflows."},{"id":"best-new-books-october-2025-reviews-recommendations","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/best-new-books-october-2025-reviews-recommendations","source":"@site/blog/2025/Oct26-2025-books-from-the-press.md","title":"Best New Books October 2025: Must-Read Releases Across Fiction and Non-Fiction","description":"Discover October 2025\u2019s standout books \u2014 from Steven Pinker\u2019s cognitive science masterpiece to Indian folklore and sports memoirs.

Consumer cars vs taxis. Consumer PCs vs business PCs. The business-grade version always outlives the shiny consumer one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s why business PCs dominate both new and used markets.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Business laptops USP\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. Reliability Out of the Box\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer laptops are built for light use, good on a store shelf. Stress them and you\u2019ll see broken hinges, dead keyboards, flimsy motherboards, and underpowered chargers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness laptops look boring, but they are engineered for 5\u20137 years of daily grind. Hinges, chargers, and keyboards are higher grade. Battery management is smarter and avoids overcharging when docked all day.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Trusted Platform Module (TPM)\\r\\n\\r\\nA dedicated security chip that stores BitLocker keys, passwords, and certificates.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Provides transparent disk encryption: your PC boots normally, but if the drive is moved to another machine, it\u2019s unreadable.\\r\\n- Caveat: if the motherboard dies, recovery requires a backup of the bitlocker keys.\\r\\n- You may need Windows 11 or 10 Pro license to get the most of this feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Intel vPro / AMD PRO\\r\\n\\r\\nNot just a CPU feature. It enables remote management at the firmware level.\\r\\n\\r\\n- IT admins can wake, patch, or wipe a laptop remotely\u2014even if powered off.\\r\\n- This is why enterprises never ship Windows Home on corporate machines.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4. Neural Processing Unit (NPU)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest upgrade in 2025 laptops (Intel Core Ultra, AMD Ryzen AI, Qualcomm Snapdragon X) also known as AI PCs lineup.\\r\\n\\r\\n- NPUs accelerate on-device AI such as Teams background blur, Copilot, and real-time translation.\\r\\n- Offloads work from CPU/GPU and improves battery life.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 5. ECC RAM (Error-Correcting Code)\\r\\n\\r\\nDetects and fixes bit flips, crucial for finance, engineering, and scientific workloads.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Common in workstations such as Dell Precision, Lenovo ThinkPad P-series, and HP ZBook.\\r\\n- Developers today find 32 GB as a sweet spot. Workstations can scale to 64\u2013128 GB if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 6. Smart Card Readers and Biometrics\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequent logins add friction. Business PCs integrate:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Smart card slots\\r\\n- Fingerprint sensors\\r\\n- IR cameras with Windows Hello\\r\\n\\r\\nHardware-based authentication is both secure and fast.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 7. Physical Locks\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kensington lock slot still exists. Rarely used at home but still standard in ThinkPads, Latitudes, and EliteBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 8. Workload Testing and Certification\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness lines undergo validation for CAD, video editing, and financial modeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Dell Precision and Lenovo ThinkPad P-series are ISV certified for tools like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and Adobe Premiere.\\r\\n- Ensures stability under heat and sustained load.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 9. Ports That Still Matter\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Macs, business laptops keep Ethernet, HDMI, multiple USB-A, C ports, and docking connectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy ports survive because enterprises still run projectors, wired keyboards, and VPN boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 10. Serviceability and Spares\\r\\n\\r\\n- Easy to swap RAM, SSD, and batteries.\\r\\n- Huge second-hand parts market due to enterprise refresh cycles.\\r\\n- Dell, Lenovo, and HP provide 5+ years of driver and firmware support.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 11. NVIDIA or Not?\\r\\n\\r\\nMost business laptops use integrated graphics only.\\r\\n\\r\\n- If workloads demand it (CAD, AI, 3D design), NVIDIA RTX or A-series workstation GPUs are offered.\\r\\n- Certified drivers ensure stability, unlike gaming GPUs.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 12. Conservative Storage Options\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard configuration is 512 GB NVMe SSD.  \\r\\nIT-managed fleets prefer predictable configurations and controlled upgrades.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 13. Thermal Engineering\\r\\n\\r\\nFans and vents are designed for cooling, not aesthetics.  \\r\\nConsumer ultrabooks overheat under load, while business laptops throttle less.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 14. Displays and Media\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard = 14-inch, FHD, anti-glare panels.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Panels are tuned for battery life and productivity, not entertainment.\\r\\n- Webcam, mic, and speakers are optimized for meetings, not binge-watching.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 15. Fast Charging Bricks\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness chargers are 90W\u2013130W, larger but faster.  \\r\\nA quick lunch break can give you 50\u201360% recharge.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 16. Wireless Audio Headsets with Mic\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Teams has revolutionized the market for audio devices. With Teams-certified devices becoming the default, wireless headsets with mics are now standard issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Depend on USB-C charging.\\r\\n- Last 2 days of moderate meetings and music.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## State of Business PCs in 2025\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness laptops have started embracing AI as a first-class feature:\\r\\n\\r\\n- NPUs are now standard in Intel Core Ultra, AMD Ryzen AI, and Qualcomm Snapdragon X series, powering on-device AI tasks without draining the GPU.\\r\\n- Windows 11 Pro integrates deeply with hardware security, making TPM and vPro more relevant than ever.\\r\\n- Enterprise models increasingly offer **Wi-Fi 7** and **5G modules** for field work.\\r\\n- Battery tech has improved, with some models offering **65Wh\u201397Wh packs** plus rapid charge, making them all-day machines.\\r\\n- Docking stations have gone fully USB-C/Thunderbolt, retiring mechanical docks but preserving enterprise workflows.\\r\\n- Eco-conscious designs are rising: modular parts, recycled materials, and longer official support lifecycles.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Enterprise Hardware Watchlist: August 2025\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an IT admin\u2019s desk, here\u2019s what business owners should track before refreshing their fleets.\\r\\n\\r\\n### CPU\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Intel Core Ultra (Meteor Lake / Lunar Lake)**: Common in Dell Latitude, HP EliteBook, Lenovo ThinkPad. Strong balance of efficiency + AI.\\r\\n- **AMD Ryzen AI 300 series**: Multi-core leaders, shipping with NPUs, used in ThinkPads and HP ProBooks.\\r\\n- **Qualcomm Snapdragon X**: ARM-based, efficient, integrated 5G, driving Microsoft Surface and select Lenovo/HP.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Memory\\r\\n\\r\\n- **16 GB LPDDR5x** is baseline, **32 GB+ DDR5/ECC** in workstations.\\r\\n- Soldered RAM in ultrabooks, modular SO-DIMMs in workstation-class devices.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Graphics / GPU\\r\\n\\r\\n- Integrated (Intel Xe, AMD Radeon, Qualcomm Adreno) good enough for most tasks.\\r\\n- NVIDIA RTX A-series still essential for CAD, 3D, ML training at the edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n### NPU\\r\\n\\r\\n- Intel AI Boost, AMD Ryzen AI, Qualcomm Hexagon: 30\u201350 TOPS on-device AI.\\r\\n- By 2025, NPUs are standard across enterprise laptops.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Display\\r\\n\\r\\n- 14\u201315.6 inch FHD+ IPS panels dominate.\\r\\n- Touchscreen and convertible form factors (HP x360, ThinkPad Yoga) gaining ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Storage\\r\\n\\r\\n- Default: 256\u2013512 GB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD.\\r\\n- Workstations: 1\u20132 TB PCIe Gen 5 SSDs, sometimes with RAID.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Webcam\\r\\n\\r\\n- 720p still lingers, but 1080p IR cameras are becoming default in premium models.\\r\\n- AI-assisted autoframing and background blur now run on NPUs.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Connectivity\\r\\n\\r\\n- USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 or 5 for docks, still keeping some USB-A and HDMI.\\r\\n- Ethernet ports survive in larger T-series/Latitude machines.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Networking\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Wi-Fi 7** standard in new 2025 refreshes.\\r\\n- Optional 5G/LTE modems in rugged and field-oriented models.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Biometrics\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fingerprint sensors standard.\\r\\n- IR cameras with Windows Hello face unlock becoming common.\\r\\n- Smart card readers still present in compliance-heavy industries.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Battery\\r\\n\\r\\n- 50\u201365 Wh packs for thin-and-light.\\r\\n- 86\u201397 Wh for mobile workstations.\\r\\n- Fast charging (50% in 30 minutes) across Dell, Lenovo, HP.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Color & Material:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Business PCs lean towards black, grey, or navy blue matte finishes \u2014 less flashy, more professional.\\r\\n- Materials: magnesium alloy (light + strong), aluminum chassis (premium feel, good thermals), and carbon fiber composites (lightweight + durable for ThinkPads).\\r\\n- Plastic-only builds are almost gone from premium lines, reserved for entry-level.\\r\\n- Fingerprint resistance coatings and MIL-STD-810H certifications are selling points for enterprise fleets.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Total Cost of Ownership and Buying Decision\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why Pay a Premium?\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness PCs almost always come with higher upfront costs, but TCO\u2014the sum of purchase, support, downtime, and productivity\u2014strongly favors business-grade hardware[3][4][10].\\r\\n\\r\\n- Studies estimate the TCO for a well-managed business laptop to range from $4,600 to $9,793 over three years, with most savings coming from reduced downtime and support costs[4].\\r\\n- A device with a 1% failure rate versus 5% can save a company over $330,000 annually per 1,000 laptops, primarily through reduced productivity loss and support expenses[4].\\r\\n- Extended warranty, sled deployment, multi-year OS support, and modular parts drive long-term value.\\r\\n- IT operations costs (OPEX) and user downtime can exceed capital costs for hardware\u2014lowering failures, easier service, and scalable deployment lead to major ROI[1][3][4].\\r\\n\\r\\n### How Should Business Owners Decide?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Match hardware to intended use:** Office tasks, fieldwork, or production workloads need corresponding device durability and support.\\r\\n- **Balance upgrade cycles and productivity:** Short cycles add complexity and expense; longer lifecycles (5+ years) minimize disruptions.\\r\\n- **Consider indirect costs:** Support, downtime, security breaches, compliance, and device failures are more expensive than the purchase price.\\r\\n- **Plan for the future:** Invest in modular, repairable hardware with warranty and vendor support. Evaluate AI features, but monitor real-world impact before heavy adoption.\\r\\n- **Engage IT and end-users:** Gather feedback from IT on manageability and from users on workflow bottlenecks.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final Word\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer PCs are designed to look good.  \\r\\nBusiness PCs are designed to last, secure, and serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a heavy user who hates downtime, a business PC\u2014new or used\u2014is still the smarter investment."},{"id":"/2025/applause-to-roasts-my-felicitation-chair-experience","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/applause-to-roasts-my-felicitation-chair-experience","source":"@site/blog/2025/applause-to-roasts-my-felicitation-chair-experience.md","title":"My Role as Felicitation Chair at the Area D5 Joint Meeting","description":"At a prestigious joint Toastmasters event featuring clubs from Hosur, Vellore, and beyond, I took the mic as Felicitation Chair.

It\'s a reflection.\\n\\nA career this long doesn\u2019t just give you experience. It gives you patterns. You start noticing what stays, what fades, and what was never real to begin with.\\n\\nThis post isn\u2019t about growth charts, anniversaries, or achievements. It\u2019s a reality check. Especially for those who entered the workforce with dreams shaped by college lectures, parental expectations, or HR onboarding decks.\\n\\nBookmark it. Revisit it. Especially when the winds change.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Jobs Are Forever \u2014 The Myth We Bought\\n\\nWe were told a job is a destination. Land one, and you\u2019re safe. Study hard, get placed, follow the system, and one day retire in peace. That illusion didn\u2019t survive its first encounter with real-world volatility. For many of us, it collapsed not in our first job, but in the uncertainty of the second or third, where layoffs weren\u2019t just newspaper headlines \u2014 they were personal. I vividly remember 2012 \u2014 hearing the word *layoff* not in a company-wide announcement, but in hushed conversations. Someone had run a SQL script to revoke access for 2,000 employees. That one line of code unraveled years of effort in milliseconds.\\n\\nLike Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata\u2019s chakra vyuha \u2014 we were trained to enter the maze, but never taught how to exit with dignity or direction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Trainings Will Save You \u2014 Another False Promise\\n\\nEvery new tool promises salvation. There\'s always a 10-hour video, a certification badge, or a learning week calendar invite. But knowledge \u2260 transformation. You can\u2019t train your way out of stagnation if you never practice. I\u2019ve seen folks with \\"12 years of experience\\" who\u2019ve actually repeated the same year twelve times.\\n\\nMeanwhile, younger teammates with fewer years and sharper instincts bulldoze ahead because they build, break, and ship things. That edge doesn\u2019t come from upskilling videos \u2014 it comes from showing up, making calls, failing fast, and bouncing back faster.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Hold Virtual Ownership \u2014 But Don\u2019t Drown in It\\n\\n\\"Take ownership\\" is on every job description and manager\u2019s checklist. But what does it actually mean in a workplace where ownership is distributed so thinly that no one has true decision power? We all know how \u201ctoo many cooks\u201d ends. At some point, everyone owns everything and yet nothing gets done. Developer productivity becomes a metric sport, while the product itself has no paying users. Market validation? Not my department. We just sprint. It feels like a rush-hour metro ride \u2014 packed, sweaty, and no one is willing to adjust for the person next to them. Everyone\'s pushing, no one knows where the train is heading.\\n\\nVirtual ownership without real influence breeds burnout. Masked as initiative, rewarded with more tasks. And if your work isn\u2019t directly influencing product adoption or revenue?  **Better believe someone\u2019s already rewriting your goodbye message.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Your Worth = A Number\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re a fresher or a VP, you are a number in a dashboard:\\n\\n- CGPA  \\n- Leetcode percentile  \\n- Story points delivered  \\n- Uptime maintained  \\n- Revenue influenced  \\n- Cost avoided  \\n\\nIf your work can\u2019t be quantified, it\u2019s sidelined. Worse \u2014 you start internalizing the idea that you\u2019re not contributing enough, even if you\u2019re the glue holding teams together. I learned this late: Emotional intelligence, long-term thinking, culture-building \u2014 these don\u2019t show up in slides. But the system demands that even these be justified with metrics. If not, you risk being seen as \\"nice to have\\" when it\'s time to downsize.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Layoffs Are Normalised \u2014 And That\u2019s Not Going Away\\n\\nLayoffs are no longer the stuff of boardroom whispers. They\'re livestream events. Scripted, staged, and delivered over Zoom.\\n\\nFrom Big Tech to startups, workforce cuts are no longer a reaction \u2014 they\'re a strategy.  \\n- It\u2019s not personal.  \\n- It\u2019s not fair.  \\n- It\u2019s just business.\\n\\nAt the time of writing this post, TCS a prestigious Indian company where several employees stayed loyal to Tata Group where put on the line called \\"first ever 2% workforce reduction\\". Illustrating the fact, no company is layoff proof. You are only as secure as the revenue forecast or funding runway. You could be the highest performer and still be asked to go because your role didn\u2019t \u201calign with priorities.\u201d\\n\\nEvery job now feels like a stock pick. You invest time, hope, and weekends into a bet that may or may not pay off. You rise and fall with the market mood.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## AI: The Elephant in Every Meeting Room\\n\\nAI is the most discussed guest in the room \u2014 invited to every conversation, understood by very few.\\n\\nIn meetings, \u201cLet\u2019s bring in AI\u201d is thrown around like a magical fix. But when asked what exactly it should do, silence follows. Truth is, **AI is today what cloud was in 2012** \u2014 full of promise, stuck in pitch decks. By 2030, AI will face its own audit. The novelty will wear off. Leaders will stop using it for press releases and start using it for results. And developers will stop fearing AI \u2014 not because it\u2019s weak, but because they\'ll finally understand what it can and can\'t do.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Mental Health Is a Joke\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy to preach balance when you\u2019re a spiritual leader with a lake-view campus and loyal donors. But when you\u2019re an employee living month-to-month, **\u201cbalance\u201d sounds like a luxury.** When townhall invites trigger dread. When one reorg wipes out months of planning. When even good work ends with a \u201chowever\u201d in the appraisal form. No wellness app will fix the anxiety of seeing colleagues disappear from Slack and payroll overnight.\\n\\nToday, every employee has at least two AI tools watching their work, recording patterns, nudging suggestions \u2014 **training to replace them** more than to support them. It\u2019s no longer fiction to imagine a future where brain-implanted AI boosts \u201cefficiency.\u201d Because hey, it\u2019s more important to track keyboard strokes than to turn off the energy-guzzling TVs still looping yesterday\u2019s metrics in an empty office bay.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Thought\\n\\nWork is no longer a straight line. It\u2019s a loop.  \\n**Learn \u2192 Build \u2192 Make money \u2192 Exit \u2192 Repeat**\\n\\n14 years in tech. 7 years in one company. This milestone isn\u2019t a victory lap. It\u2019s a checkpoint. A reminder to stay **adaptable**, **humble**, and **detached**. Because in this industry, one truth reigns above all:\\n\\n**Impermanence isn\u2019t a bug \u2014 it\u2019s the default setting.**"},{"id":"/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2","source":"@site/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2.md","title":"Digital Discipline 2.0: Mesh Networks, NextDNS, and the Ongoing Battle Against YouTube","description":"A nerd-dad\u2019s ongoing quest to baby-proof not just the furniture\u2014but the family\u2019s Wi-Fi and screens.

The never-ending chase to block YouTube.com for good.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as always, the story gets more interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Parental Control Problem \u2014 ISP Routers Just Don\u2019t Cut It\\r\\n\\r\\nThe so-called \u201cparental controls\u201d on most ISP-supplied hardware are a masquerade. The DNS fields are locked down; your hands are tied. For real filtering, the only way out is to move to your own hardware so I picked up a **TP-Link mesh router** supporting true mesh networking.\\r\\n\\r\\nMesh brings coverage, flexibility, and\u2014crucially\u2014three distinct SSIDs:\\r\\n- **Default**\\r\\n- **Guest**\\r\\n- **Smart Devices**\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with **NextDNS** set at the router level, everything in the house bows to centralized rules.\\r\\n\\r\\n## NextDNS Profiles: Access Levels Like IAM for Humans\\r\\n\\r\\nOne genius detail about NextDNS is its profile-based filtering, think of it like authorization groups in IAM. Here\u2019s how my rules stack up:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Default:** YouTube is blocked everywhere, the good citizens\u2019 network.\\r\\n- **Elders:** YouTube allowed (but only when the baby\u2019s not around).\\r\\n- **Dev Mode:** Everything permitted\u2014for me, when it\u2019s time to break things or fix them.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Side effect:* some analytics break, and anyone with the Tor app can waltz past the controls. It\u2019s not bulletproof, but it\u2019s pretty resilient.\\r\\n\\r\\n## SaaS Fatigue and the DIY Fix\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s the catch: **NextDNS\u2019s free plan caps at 30,000 DNS requests/month**. That\u2019s enough for one or two users, but add a full house and you\u2019ll hit the wall. The fear: getting locked into yet another SaaS subscription for every single filter.\\r\\n\\r\\n- *Temporary solution:* Careful rationing, multiple profiles, and possibly automating some extra DNS protection. Still, I have DIY plans brewing to avoid lifelong lock-in.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Result: Under Control\u2026 For Now\\r\\n\\r\\nWith distinct SSIDs, granular DNS filtering, and profile-based controls, the home network feels far more intentional and secure. The only wildcard? Human factors, will elders and guests play along or look for loopholes?\\r\\n\\r\\n> I personally save nearly 2 hours a day with no youtube, thats 30 days saved per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for now, digital discipline is stronger than ever. Parenthood is chaos; your network doesn\u2019t have to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n*To fellow parents: tweaking your network takes patience, but the peace of mind is worth it.

Eight years of companionship, memories etched into plastic keys and flickering screens. This was not just a laptop; it was a cherished confidant, a silent witness to late-night hustles, travels, and the fragile trust between creator and machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even strong bonds can snap. On a monsoon-drenched evening, fate delivered a blow. The Dell service center greeted me somberly, where a sticker cheerily warned about \u201cmonsoon laptop care\u201d\u2014advice, in my case, a little too late. The diagnosis: my beloved Dell Inspiron, dead on arrival. There were no heroic rescues, just a silent mourning and the slow ache that follows a familiar loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fallout was immediate. Backlogs grew like weeds. Blogs languished in drafts as an interim Dell Vostro\u2014salvaged from the garage and coaxed to life with Debian\u2014struggled beneath the weight of creative ambition. The void left by the Inspiron haunted every click. Sooner or later, I knew: it was time to let go and move on.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Pursuit of Power And Value\\r\\n\\r\\nI dreamt, briefly, of a desktop\u2014a machine built on ChatGPT-powered advice, futuristic and mighty. But reality grinned: a 3\u20135 lakh rupee price tag. It felt absurd, the cost outweighing the gains, with the grey cloud of warranty uncertainty looming. Dell\u2019s tower PCs were impossible to \u201cadd to cart\u201d without wading through conversations with bots; the tempting A51 desktop was a crush at first sight, quickly doomed by its price\u2014well above \u20b95 lakhs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe configurations under Dell\u2019s \u201cWorkstation\u201d banner cost more than a new Ather Pro scooter. Disheartened, I wandered into the wilds of OLX, mentorless but hopeful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn OLX, the market teemed with budget laptops\u2014plentiful at 25k, but the beasts I needed lurked rarely, cloaked behind search filters: \u201cDell i7\u201d, \u201c50k and above\u201d. And yet, despite Apple\u2019s siren song and options aplenty, my heart stayed loyal to Dell\u2014perhaps from habit, perhaps nostalgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn OLX, two sellers emerged: individuals hoping for a fair price, and seasoned shopkeepers flipping out-of-warranty stock. Caution prevailed; I chose the latter. Stranger meets in unknown places\u2014money flashing on UPI\u2014felt like a recipe for disaster. I wanted reliability, not adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Resurrection: Enter Dell 7620\\r\\n\\r\\n[RG Computer, Belandur](https://www.rgcomputers.in/) was unassuming\u2014a small shop, a friendly shopkeeper, and an attentive assistant. There, among reclaimed silicon, sat my contender: the Dell 7560. (Specs to come.) The inspection ritual began:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Checked the Dell service tag, verified the model\u2019s lineage.\\r\\n- Scanned for scars\u2014deep or faint\u2014from previous lives.\\r\\n- BIOS revealed battery health and year of manufacture (both scrutinized).\\r\\n- Booted and rebooted, measuring patience.\\r\\n- Ran HW Info, checked SSD specs\u2014ensuring no deceit hid beneath the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopkeeper walked me through their refurbishing process\u2014old NVMe swapped for a fresh NVMe, a subtle upsell attempt gracefully declined. After two hours, I still forgot to check every key, but luck favored me; all were functional.\\r\\n\\r\\nArmed with a bill and three months of shop-backed warranty, I walked out\u2014lighter in heart, heavier in hand. The workstation is, in a word, solid. I do not recommend carrying it around on your back, its indeed heavy. I use my Dell Vostro for light work on the move.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Meet the Beast: Dell 7620\\r\\n\\r\\n- Intel i7, 11th Gen, 8 cores @2.50GHz  \\r\\n- 32GB DDR4 RAM  \\r\\n- 512GB healthy NVMe storage  \\r\\n- Nvidia 6GB graphics  \\r\\n- Windows 11 Pro  \\r\\n\\r\\nThings I Don\u2019t Understand Yet\\r\\n\\r\\n- The 180W charger\u2014why such a power-hungry beast for this machine?  \\r\\n- The air vents, reminiscent of a car radiator, puzzling me with their design and purpose.  \\r\\n- The CPU core temperatures, often hovering at 50\xb0C and above\u2014stable or stealth warning?  \\r\\n\\r\\nRed Flags? Of course:  \\r\\n- Out of Dell warranty, over four years old  \\r\\n- Noticeable signs of prior use  \\r\\n- Fingerprint sensor, more gimmick than guardian  \\r\\n\\r\\nBut for \u20b955k? In my urgency, the deal felt fair. Back at the desk, it stood firm\u2014two USB-Cs, two USBs, HDMI, and a DP port. It powers two monitors, a cooling pad, and more. The webcam is decent (bonus: a privacy slider).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Epilogue: Grief, Growth, Gratitude\\r\\n\\r\\nThree weeks in, I\u2019m surprised by the stability. I\u2019m building again\u2014products, content, momentum. The wound from the monsoon disaster remains, but it\u2019s fading, replaced by a story of resilience and renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Overall rating: 4.5/5.** For a refurbished warrior and a rekindled creator\u2019s journey."},{"id":"/2025/preparing-home-network-before-first-child","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/preparing-home-network-before-first-child","source":"@site/blog/2025/preparing-home-network-before-first-child.md","title":"Baby on Board, Firewalls Up: A New Dad\u2019s Guide to Internet Hygiene at Home","description":"How to baby-proof your home network and devices for your child\u2019s safety.

You\u2019ve probably baby-proofed your furniture, but what about your Wi-Fi and devices? In today\u2019s world, computer networks are as important as cribs and car seats. Here\u2019s how I\u2014a nerdy new dad\u2014secured my digital den for my family\u2019s safety and sanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1: Understand Your Home Network Like a Responsible Adult\\r\\n\\r\\nMost homes today have more than one way to get online, even if you don\u2019t realize it. **Computer networks** are everywhere\u2014broadband, mobile data, and hotspots.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Count the Networks\\r\\n\\r\\n**Total Networks at home =** 1 broadband + each phone with an active mobile data plan\\r\\n\\r\\nThat means your child\u2019s screen time could sneak in through any of these entry points. First step: identify and isolate them.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Basic Network Topology (Before Changes)\\r\\n\\r\\n> Internet \u2192 ISP Router (Wi-Fi & LAN) \u2192 All Devices \u2192 your child\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gives the ISP\u2019s router full control over DNS, firewall rules, and device access. Not ideal for a security-conscious parent.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Smart phones + data packs \u2192 your child\\r\\n\\r\\nData packs by carrier don\u2019t give any parental control tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to target the network-level filtering, which is generally good enough to block ads, parked domains, and time wasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Fix the Manhole \u2014 Lock Down Your Broadband\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why ISP Routers Are a Problem\\r\\n\\r\\n- Most ISP routers are locked down\u2014DNS settings greyed out\\r\\n- Firmware is often outdated and insecure\\r\\n- Limited or no parental control features\\r\\n- No custom firewall or VLAN options\\r\\n\\r\\n### What I Did Instead\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Disabled Wi-Fi on the ISP router**  \\r\\n   Let it act as a basic modem or Layer 2 switch.\\r\\n2. **Introduced My Own Router (Netgear)**  \\r\\n   Plugged into the ISP box via Ethernet (LAN to WAN). This separates my internal LAN from the ISP\u2019s network.\\r\\n3. **Enabled NAT, DHCP, and DNS on My Router**  \\r\\n   Configured to issue private IPs (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) and point all DNS queries to **OpenDNS** servers:\\r\\n   - `208.67.222.222`\\r\\n   - `208.67.220.220`\\r\\n4. **Registered with OpenDNS**  \\r\\n   Created a free account, added my dynamic IP, and enabled category-level filtering. You can block:\\r\\n   - Social networks\\r\\n   - Video sharing\\r\\n   - Adult content\\r\\n   - Gaming, shopping, forums\u2014up to you\\r\\n5. **Tested the Setup**  \\r\\n   Verified DNS override by visiting:  \\r\\n   [https://welcome.opendns.com](https://welcome.opendns.com)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Updated Network Topology\\r\\n\\r\\nAll devices now talk to the internet via **my firewall + DNS filters**, not the ISP\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3: Taming the Phones\u2014Especially the Ones With Data Packs\\r\\n\\r\\nBroadband is fixed, but what about **mobile data** on phones? These are the real backdoors in your computer networks.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Simple But Effective Plan\\r\\n\\r\\n- Recharge only when needed (no monthly auto-renewal of data-heavy packs)\\r\\n- Use mobile data only for OTPs, emergency maps, and short bursts\\r\\n\\r\\n### The Engineer\u2019s Setup\\r\\n\\r\\nI needed something **robust and centrally managed**.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **For Broadband Devices** \u2013 I use **OpenDNS** via the router.\\r\\n2. **For Mobile Data (4G/5G) Devices** \u2013 I use **NextDNS** via Android/iPhone\u2019s Private DNS feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Why NextDNS?\\r\\n\\r\\n- Supports DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)\\r\\n- Per-device logs, analytics, and block rules\\r\\n- Works even over mobile data, friends\u2019 hotspot\\r\\n- One profile can be shared across multiple devices\\r\\n- For entire family, basic plan is worth it. Free plan is limited.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to Set It Up on Android\\r\\n\\r\\n- Go to: `Settings > Network & Internet > Private DNS`\\r\\n- Choose: `Private DNS provider hostname`\\r\\n- Enter: `your-profile-id.dns.nextdns.io` (from nextdns.io dashboard)\\r\\n- Save and test at: [https://test.nextdns.io](https://test.nextdns.io)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow even on 4G, your DNS traffic is encrypted and filtered.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Bigger Motive: Family-Wide Digital Discipline\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn\u2019t just about protecting a newborn. It\u2019s about reprogramming how **we** use computer networks and the internet\u2014so that the baby doesn\u2019t see everyone glued to screens 24/7.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What We\u2019re Trying to Do\\r\\n\\r\\n- Remove addictive triggers from devices\\r\\n- Encourage meaningful use of tech\\r\\n- Create consistency across screens\\r\\n- Lead by example\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a one-man battle. It\u2019s a full-stack family-level architecture decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Problems Faced\\r\\n\\r\\n### Technical\\r\\n\\r\\n- Changing DNS is straightforward if you\u2019re used to router admin pages.\\r\\n- Most modern routers support this out of the box.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Psychological\\r\\n\\r\\n- Asking aging parents to give up binge-watching YouTube is like asking them to skip tea.\\r\\n- You\u2019ll hear:\\r\\n  - \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with watching one or two reels?\u201d\\r\\n  - \u201cIt\u2019s just a recipe video...?\u201d\\r\\n- Prepare for mini mutinies, emotional blackmail, and silent resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Financial\\r\\n\\r\\n- Another subscription added, hopefully Netflix & Prime go away\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if you stick to it, it gets easier.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Advanced Nerd Notes\\r\\n\\r\\n- **DNS Leak Protection**: Use firewall rules to block outbound port 53 and redirect to OpenDNS.\\r\\n- **Split VLANs**: For homes with smart TVs and IoT devices, separate them into guest VLANs.\\r\\n- **Device MAC Tracking**: Some routers let you assign policies per MAC address (for kids vs adults).\\r\\n- **Dynamic DNS**: If your IP changes often, configure DDNS and bind it to OpenDNS/NextDNS updates.\\r\\n- **Logs & Analytics**: Use Pi-hole or Netflow on a Raspberry Pi to monitor domain requests for forensic insights.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Disclaimer\\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019m not selling any tool here. This blog is about the **mindset shift** required to raise children in the age of digital dopamine.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse any tool you prefer.

Here are **3 classic struggles** that keep popping up, no matter how fast the AI world moves.\\n\\n![](../assets/2025/senior-junior.webp)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **1. Senior vs. Junior Conundrum \u2013 The Banyan Tree Effect**\\n\\nJuniors often feel like they\u2019re **growing in the shadow** of their seniors \u2013 those **strong, wide-spread banyan trees** that **block opportunities** and stunt their growth. This isn\u2019t just a theory \u2013 data shows that **nearly 30% of techies** with **less than 3 years of experience** switch jobs, looking for **more sunlight and fresh air**.\\n\\nFor juniors, the challenge isn\u2019t just the learning curve but **finding their voice** in a team where the seniors have already taken the best seats. It\u2019s like trying to grow a startup in a market dominated by FAANG.\\n\\nWhile seniors are busy debating the **best design pattern for a microservice**, juniors are trying to get their **first pull request merged** without being roasted on the code review thread. It\u2019s a constant game of **\\"How many comments will this PR get before it\u2019s finally approved?\\"**, **\\"Will anyone mentor me honestly about all corners of the long career ahead?\\"**, etc.\\n\\nSeniors, on the other hand, see juniors as a **potential threat** \u2013 the fresh minds who come in armed with **JavaScript, Python, and React** and casually throw around terms like **LLMs**, **prompt engineering**, **hackathons** and **vector databases**. Meanwhile, the seniors are still perfecting the art of **Spring Boot** and **JPA**, occasionally grumbling about how **Java 8** was the last \u201creal\u201d upgrade.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not just about skills \u2013 it\u2019s about **mindset**. The seniors have survived **production outages at 3 AM**, managed **political office battles**, and **honestly mentored** a generation of developers who now run startups.\\n\\nJuniors, on the other hand, are still fresh, living out of **PG rooms**, debugging their code on **15-inch laptops**, and pushing code on a **5G hotspot** while dodging their roommate\u2019s PUBG screams. They may lack experience, but they have the raw **hustle, curiosity, and caffeine tolerance** that seniors often lose along the way.\\n\\nAnd if you want a real generational gap, just bring up **Agile vs. Waterfall** in a meeting. The seniors will reminisce about the days when **project plans were thicker than the SRS document**, while the juniors wonder if they should include **Agile Scrum** in their LinkedIn profile.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **2. Employee vs. Management \u2013 The Cost-Cutting Showdown**\\n\\nWhen it comes to cutting costs, **management** often takes the path of least resistance \u2013 **reduce headcount**. Performance, age, location, experience \u2013 all fair game when trimming the payroll. This is the **\\"high-impact, low-cost\\"** strategy that features in every MBA case study.\\n\\nFrom the management perspective, it\u2019s all about **\\"optimizing the org chart\\"** and **\\"maximizing shareholder value\\"** \u2013 fancy phrases that essentially mean **fewer people, more profit**. The logic is simple: cutting the bottom 10% might save the company **millions** without the **PR disaster** of reducing executive perks.\\n\\nBut employees see it differently. To them, the real savings lie in **cutting the fat at the top**. After all, the **CEO earning 100x** the average developer\u2019s salary, **VPs** flying business class, and middle managers enjoying plush perks attending meetings.\\n\\nAnd then there\u2019s the **perks debate**. Employees argue that cutting **free food, and fancy offices** in favor of **WFH (Work From Home)** could save millions. After all, those ping-pong tables and **bean bags** aren\u2019t exactly mission-critical. And let\u2019s be real \u2013 the only people who truly use the office gym are the same ones who have the time for **marathon LinkedIn posts**.\\n\\nThis is especially stark in India, where **C-level executives** at top tech firms earn **crores per annum**, while a fresh developer might make **7-15 LPA**. The disparity is not just in the paychecks but also in the **power to decide the fate of others**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **3. The Outsourcing Squeeze \u2013 A Tale of Two Realities**\\n\\nOutsourcing is a simple idea \u2013 move work to a cheaper location and **save big**. India, with its massive pool of **highly skilled engineers**, is a top destination for this. In 2024 alone, India\u2019s **IT exports** were estimated at over **\\\\$250 billion**, with **GCCs (Global Capability Centers)** in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai leading the charge.\\n\\nBut this efficiency comes with a human cost. For every American worker laid off, there\u2019s likely a replacement in Bangalore, Manila, or Chengdu doing the same work at a fraction of the cost. It\u2019s the **\\"rob Peter to pay Paul\\"** strategy of the corporate world.\\n\\nBut it\u2019s not a bed of roses for the outsourcers either. They\u2019re often stuck in **corporate jungles** \u2013 the GCCs of India \u2013 doing the same work for **3x-5x less pay** than their Western counterparts, with fewer perks, **less vacation**, and the constant **contract renewal threats**.\\n\\nAnd to add to their woes, the **entry-level salaries** at these GCCs have barely moved in the past **15 years**, despite inflation and the rising cost of living. It\u2019s like getting a **static variable** in a **dynamic world**.\\n\\nPlus, they have to **sync up at 11 PM** for calls with **PST** time zone clients who think that **IST** stands for **\\"I\u2019ll Slack Tomorrow.\\"**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis post is a simple **rant for the slump** \u2013 not to be taken seriously. There are many more battles in tech, like **open source vs. closed source**, **cloud vs. on-prem**, and **Windows vs. Mac**. I\u2019ll tackle those when the next writer\u2019s block hits. \ud83d\ude09"},{"id":"/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends","source":"@site/blog/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends.md","title":"Bridging the Gap: CAP Theorem for Senior React Developers","description":"Learn CAP Theorem using Git and real-time React apps.

But many of us hit a career plateau because we lack exposure to core software engineering principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis post is part of a growing genre I call **\u201cBridge Posts\u201d**\u2014connecting frontend development to foundational software architecture concepts. The goal is to help frontend engineers think like system designers, not just component builders.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we explore the **CAP Theorem**, a classic principle in distributed systems, and map it to familiar frontend scenarios\u2014such as Git workflows, real-time collaborative UIs, and offline-friendly apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Understanding the CAP Theorem\\r\\n\\r\\nIn distributed systems, the **CAP Theorem** states that during a network partition (i.e., some parts of the system can\u2019t communicate), you can only guarantee **two of the following three**:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Consistency (C):** All nodes see the same data at the same time.\\r\\n* **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response\u2014regardless of the freshness of the data.\\r\\n* **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate even when parts of it can\u2019t communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, **partition tolerance** is non-negotiable in any distributed system. Therefore, systems must choose between consistency and availability when partitions occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Git Analogy: You Already Use CAP\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s start with Git\u2014a tool every developer knows.\\r\\n\\r\\n* When you commit locally on a plane, you\u2019re in a **partitioned state**.\\r\\n* You can continue working (**Availability**), even though your code may diverge from your teammate\u2019s (**Consistency** is compromised).\\r\\n* Once reconnected, you **merge** changes to restore consistency.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Git is an AP (Available + Partition-Tolerant) system**. It tolerates partitions and lets you work offline but eventually requires reconciliation.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## React Use Case: Real-Time Collaborative Forms\\r\\n\\r\\nNow imagine you\u2019re building a collaborative form in React. Multiple users edit the same form in real-time. Updates are synchronized via WebSockets or polling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does CAP play out here?\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. **CP \u2013 Consistent & Partition-Tolerant**\\r\\n\\r\\n* If a user loses network connectivity, editing is disabled.\\r\\n* This ensures everyone always sees the latest state.\\r\\n* However, the application becomes unavailable for offline or disconnected users.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Use cases:** Healthcare apps, finance platforms\u2014where data integrity is paramount.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. **AP \u2013 Available & Partition-Tolerant**\\r\\n\\r\\n* Users can continue editing offline.\\r\\n* Changes are stored locally and synced later.\\r\\n* This may lead to **conflicting edits**, requiring merge strategies.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Use cases:** Note-taking apps, chat applications\u2014where user flow matters more than perfect sync.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. **CA \u2013 Consistent & Available (No Partition Tolerance)**\\r\\n\\r\\n* Works as expected under perfect network conditions.\\r\\n* Any partition causes the system to fail or block.\\r\\n* While theoretically ideal, **this model is impractical in real-world distributed systems**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83c\udf10 Designing for Partition Tolerance\\r\\n\\r\\nA **network partition** occurs when different components of a distributed system\u2014clients, services, or databases\u2014cannot communicate due to a temporary network failure. Each component may still be operational, but they\'re isolated like islands without bridges.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn frontend development, this is surprisingly common:\\r\\n\\r\\n* A user loses internet connectivity mid-session.\\r\\n* A mobile app hits a dead spot with no signal.\\r\\n* The frontend can reach a CDN or cache but not the main API server.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Designing for Partition Tolerance** means your app should continue functioning as gracefully as possible, even during such disconnects.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### As a React developer, this involves:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Storing user actions locally (memory, localStorage, IndexedDB).\\r\\n* Queuing mutations and syncing later (e.g., Service Workers, Apollo cache, Redux middleware).\\r\\n* Providing clear UI cues: \u201cYou\u2019re offline, changes will sync later.\u201d\\r\\n* Implementing conflict resolution logic, if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nReal-world examples:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Figma** continues rendering and recording user edits during disconnects.\\r\\n* **Notion** lets you type offline and syncs the block tree later.\\r\\n* **Gmail** stores draft emails offline and sends them once reconnected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese applications **opt for Partition Tolerance**, ensuring the app remains usable\u2014even if consistency is delayed or temporarily broken.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Designing for Partition Tolerance doesn\u2019t mean ignoring consistency\u2014it means accepting that consistency might be *eventual*, not immediate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn distributed systems, **network failures are not rare edge cases\u2014they\'re expected events.** As frontend engineers, acknowledging and designing for them elevates your thinking from component trees to system-level resilience.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Mapping CAP to Frontend Patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n| Frontend Pattern                              | CAP Tradeoff             | Notes                                             |\\r\\n| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |\\r\\n| React Query (stale-while-revalidate)          | AP                       | Shows stale cache first, fetches fresh data.      |\\r\\n| Optimistic UI (e.g., message send)            | AP                       | Assumes success and syncs with the server later.  |\\r\\n| Disabling forms on lost connection            | CP                       | Prevents stale writes by enforcing consistency.   |\\r\\n| Service Workers / Offline-First PWA           | AP                       | Operates offline and reconciles post-reconnect.   |\\r\\n| Live collaboration (e.g., Figma, Google Docs) | AP + conflict resolution | Resolves sync issues with operational transforms. |\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## What This Means for Frontend Developers\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\u2019t have to be building a distributed database to care about CAP. If your application:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Caches remote data**\\r\\n* **Lets users work offline**\\r\\n* **Supports multi-user collaboration**\\r\\n* **Relies on eventual consistency**\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2026then you\u2019re actively navigating CAP trade-offs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsk yourself:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Can users work with stale data? \u2192 Choose **Availability**.\\r\\n* Must every write be accurate and conflict-free? \u2192 Prioritize **Consistency**.\\r\\n* Should the app always respond\u2014even during outages? \u2192 Design for **Partition Tolerance**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Closing Thoughts: Frontend as a Distributed System\\r\\n\\r\\n> **\u201cCAP isn\u2019t just a backend concern\u2014it manifests in every interactive, networked UI you build.\u201d**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you\u2019re building a rich client with React Query, crafting optimistic updates, or designing for offline-first usage, you\u2019re constantly making trade-offs. Understanding CAP helps you make them consciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis post was part of a broader mission to elevate frontend engineers into system thinkers\u2014developers who don\u2019t just build buttons, but design resilient user experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s not be cookie-cutter React developers.

From ChatGPT to custom AI copilots, LLMs are everywhere. But have you ever wondered **how LLMs actually work** under the hood?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory behind LLMs can be complex\u2014terms like _embeddings_, _transformers_, _tokenization_, and _vector space_ often feel overwhelming. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using a familiar analogy: a visit to a **local doctor\u2019s clinic**.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis blog post breaks down **the internal architecture of LLMs** using a real-world story that\u2019s easy to visualize and remember. Whether you\'re a developer exploring AI integration, an engineer curious about embeddings, or someone building chat interfaces, this analogy-driven explanation will help you understand:\\r\\n\\r\\n- What tokenization really means  \\r\\n- Why vectors and embeddings are essential  \\r\\n- How transformers \\"think\\" using attention  \\r\\n- Why temperature affects LLM creativity  \\r\\n- How memory and context shape outputs  \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s walk into the clinic. \ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8a\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Characters in the Community Clinic Example\\r\\n\\r\\n- **User** \u2013 A person interacting with the LLM (the patient)\\r\\n- **LLM** \u2013 The large language model (the doctor)\\r\\n- **Internals** \u2013 Sequence of steps the model uses to generate a response (diagnostic workflow)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1: Patient Describes the Issue to Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n**Scene:**  \\r\\nThe patient walks into the clinic.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Conversation:**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n- Doctor: Hi, please sit down.\\r\\n- Patient: Thank you.\\r\\n- Doctor: Tell me.\\r\\n- Patient: I got back from my friend\u2019s wedding 2 days back. Since yesterday, I feel cold and have body pains.\\r\\n- Doctor: (listening) hmm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**LLM Analogy:**  \\r\\nThis step is like **tokenization** \u2014 breaking the input sentence into smaller units (tokens) that the machine can understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Step 1 - Tokenizer:**  \\r\\n> Converts input from human language to machine-readable tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input:** Plain text / story  \\r\\n- **Output:** Word tokens (e.g., \\"wedding\\", \\"cold\\", \\"pains\\")\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Doctor Comprehends the Patient Problem\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor interprets the patient\u2019s words and thinks in terms of temperature, symptoms, etc. They may even order diagnostic tests for more data.\\r\\n\\r\\n**LLM Analogy:**  \\r\\nThis is like the **embedding layer**, where word tokens are turned into number arrays (vectors) that hold semantic meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Step 2 - Embedding Layer:**  \\r\\n> Converts tokens into vector form for semantic understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input:** Word tokens  \\r\\n- **Output:** Vectors that represent meaning (like symptoms turned into medical data)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 3: Doctor Runs Diagnosis Internally\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor thinks through the problem using experience and logic\u2014checking symptoms against patterns they\u2019ve seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\n**LLM Analogy:**  \\r\\nThis is the **transformer architecture**\u2014especially self-attention layers, which compare words across the sentence to extract meaning and decide what matters most.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Step 3 - Transformer Layers:**  \\r\\n> Deep learning steps like self-attention and feedforward networks.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input:** Vectors  \\r\\n- **Output:** Context-aware vectors based on internal learned patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 4: Doctor Considers Constraints (like budget)\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctors don\u2019t always prescribe expensive tests\u2014patient affordability, practicality, and history all affect decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n**LLM Analogy:**  \\r\\nThis step is like **positional encoding**\u2014ensuring the model understands the order and structure of the sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Step 4 - Positional Encoding:**  \\r\\n> Adds position-related meaning to vectors.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input:** Related vector tokens  \\r\\n- **Output:** Ordered vector tokens based on sentence position\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5: Doctor Writes a Prescription\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor now documents the diagnosis and treatment. It\u2019s a direct result of structured thinking and patient input.\\r\\n\\r\\n**LLM Analogy:**  \\r\\nThis is where the model **decodes** the internal vector into a predicted sequence of tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Step 5 - Decoder:**  \\r\\n> Generates output tokens based on model\u2019s confidence and logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input:** Positional vectors  \\r\\n- **Output:** Probable tokens in correct context\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 6: Doctor Shares the Prescription with the Patient\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final interaction. If the patient is nervous, doctor might tweak the recommendation. This is where human nuance enters.\\r\\n\\r\\n**LLM Analogy:**  \\r\\nThe LLM now converts tokens back into human-readable words. Here, **temperature** plays a role in how creative or safe the response is.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Step 6 - Output Layer:**  \\r\\n> Converts final vector into output text based on temperature setting.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input:** Final vector  \\r\\n- **Output:** Natural language sentence\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Bonus Step: The Doctor Remembers Your Previous Visit\\r\\n\\r\\nLLMs with **memory or context windows** can remember prior conversations, like a doctor recognizing returning patients. This helps give better, contextual responses in multi-turn dialogues.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like a good doctor doesn\u2019t Google your symptoms in front of you, a well-trained LLM doesn\u2019t \\"think\\" in real-time. It applies complex math on pre-learned data to predict and autocomplete responses.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Words \u2192 Tokens \u2192 Vectors \u2192 Patterns \u2192 Tokens \u2192 Words**\\r\\n- Everything happens in **vector space**, not in \\"language\\" as humans know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\u2019re building with tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, or **embedding-powered RAG applications**, understanding these LLM fundamentals gives you a huge advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n> \ud83e\udde0 \\"A well-trained LLM is just a super-fast autocomplete that has read the entire internet.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \u2728 Takeaways for Developers\\r\\n\\r\\n- Tokenization = Parsing human input  \\r\\n- Embedding = Understanding meaning  \\r\\n- Transformer = Core logic engine / Deep learning\\r\\n- Positional Encoding = Sentence structure  \\r\\n- Decoding = Constructing a response  \\r\\n- Temperature = Tuning creativity  \\r\\n- Context = Remembering past interactions\\r\\n\\r\\nLLMs don\u2019t reason like humans\u2014but they recognize patterns with superhuman speed. Now you can too.

But have you ever considered the power of a **not-to-do list**? It\'s about consciously identifying habits or activities that no longer serve your goals and removing them. Here\'s my not-to-do list for 2025, crafted with the intent to stay focused, efficient, and aligned with my evolving priorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. No More Public GitHub Repos  \\r\\n\\r\\nOpen-source contribution has been a cornerstone of the tech world, and I\u2019ve had my share of excitement from it. But with the rise of AI tools, the landscape is changing. Unless you\u2019re a core maintainer of a prominent library, the recognition that once came from showcasing code has diminished.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2025, I\u2019ll shift my energy toward **building meaningful products and functionalities** rather than maintaining a public code showcase. The focus will be on solving problems and creating impact\u2014where the real value lies.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. No Social Media Overload  \\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media can be a double-edged sword. It\u2019s a goldmine for networking, but it\u2019s also a time sink designed for immersion and doomscrolling. With AI tools providing quick insights (even without sitting through a 40-minute video), my reliance on these platforms will be minimal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s my plan: **Engage with social media just once a week for an hour**, in the following order:  \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Facebook** for personal updates.  \\r\\n2. **LinkedIn** for professional networking.  \\r\\n3. **GitHub Feed** to track industry trends.  \\r\\n4. **Twitter/X** for niche topics and hot takes.  \\r\\n5. **YouTube Subscriptions** for targeted learning.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll curate a list of websites to stay updated instead of depending on algorithm-driven feeds.  \\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking from the office puts you into a routine which is a supporting stick for those who lack self discipline of waking up early, switching subjects under work naturally. Thats why I am against working from office on select days of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4. No More Reading Goals  \\r\\n\\r\\nI used to pride myself on being a voracious reader, devouring two books a week. But life evolves, and so do habits. For two consecutive years, I failed to hit my reading goals\u2014and that\u2019s okay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2025, I\u2019ll stop setting rigid reading goals. Instead, I\u2019ll use mobile apps that provide **daily book summaries** to stay updated with the latest titles. Physical books will still have a place in my collection, but the pressure to meet arbitrary goals will be a thing of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 5. No More Video Courses Unless I\u2019ve Tried and Failed  \\r\\n\\r\\nVideo courses are everywhere\u2014just one click away. But they often require hours of commitment, and many simply repackage information available in documentation or books.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMoving forward, I\u2019ll treat video courses as a **last resort**. I\u2019ll prioritize **reading documentation**, **experimenting**, and leveraging AI for quick answers. If I still hit roadblocks, only then will I invest time in a course. The same logic applies to interviews or tutorials\u2014AI can summarize key insights faster than a 60-minute watch.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill  \\r\\n\\r\\n2025 is about **action over abstraction**. Instead of endlessly documenting best practices or creating small libraries, I\u2019ll focus on:  \\r\\n\\r\\n- **Building real applications** for my portfolio.  \\r\\n- **Leveraging AI for 5x upskilling**.  \\r\\n- Prioritizing **actual product development** over pre/post-work content.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s time to let go of distractions and double down on meaningful work. Here\u2019s to a focused and fulfilling year ahead!  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\u2019s on your **not-to-do list** for 2025?

From entertainment to education, it\u2019s a treasure trove of information waiting to be tapped. However, like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By channeling our time on YouTube towards productive endeavors, we can unlock immense value. Here are three transformative lessons I\u2019ve learned from YouTube in 2024, which have reshaped my perspective and enriched my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing is more frustrating than being technically inclined yet unable to handle minor repairs. For many, minor fixes\u2014whether it\u2019s a laptop issue or a motorcycle\u2014are often overlooked by mechanics or seen as unworthy of their time. Insurance companies don\u2019t cover such small mishaps, and for the owner, they\u2019re just time-wasters. But learning to perform these tasks yourself is a game-changer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough YouTube, I\u2019ve gained the confidence to tackle these challenges. DIY repair videos have become my go-to resource before making any major purchases. For instance:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Most business-grade laptops have detailed repair tutorials available.\\r\\n- Popular vehicles, like Maruti cars, also have a wealth of content explaining common issues and fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis newfound skill has transformed how I make purchase decisions. DIY repairability is now a core factor in my selection framework. The ability to fix things with my own hands not only saves money but also fosters a sense of independence and ownership.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Pro Tip:** Before buying any big or expensive item, check if it is DIY repair-friendly. It can save you a lot of hassle down the line.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Financial Frameworks for Life: Learn from Real Stories\\r\\n\\r\\nConversations around finance often revolve around trades, insurance, or IPOs, but rarely delve into overarching financial frameworks or strategies for building wealth. Thanks to YouTube, we can now access diverse perspectives and stories from people at different stages of their financial journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust today, I watched two fascinating videos:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A story about a betting addict burdened by debt\u2014a cautionary tale of financial mismanagement.\\r\\n2. The inspiring journey of a top-level executive who retired early to live sustainably on a farm. Their financial strategy included years of disciplined saving and investments, supplemented by income from startups. Here\u2019s their asset allocation:\\r\\n   - 40% in real estate, including their farm.\\r\\n   - 40% in equities and mutual funds.\\r\\n   - 10% in gold.\\r\\n   - 10% in liquid funds for emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese narratives offer invaluable insights and practical frameworks for managing personal finances.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Key Takeaway:** Before you quit your job, ensure you have a solid financial runway. Asset allocation is crucial for long-term stability.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. Tech Events Live: Stay Ahead of the Curve\\r\\n\\r\\nFor developers and tech enthusiasts, attending global conferences like Next.js Conf or Google I/O often seems like a distant dream. Enter YouTube, the ultimate equalizer. With live streams and recorded sessions, anyone, anywhere, can stay updated on the latest trends and technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, I tuned into multiple tech events that would have been impossible to attend in person. These events not only kept me informed but also inspired me to stay ahead in my career. The ability to access these resources at your convenience is a game-changer for lifelong learning.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Actionable Insight:** Don\u2019t miss out on tech trends\u2014attend virtual events and conferences through YouTube.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary: Guardrails for Growth\\r\\n\\r\\nYouTube is undoubtedly a powerful platform for learning and growth. However, navigating it effectively requires discipline. The abundance of content can quickly lead to doom-scrolling and distractions if we\u2019re not careful. By setting guardrails and focusing on purposeful content, we can turn YouTube into a tool for self-improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Final Thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key to harnessing YouTube\u2019s potential lies in intentionality. Whether it\u2019s mastering DIY repairs, building financial acumen, or staying updated with industry trends, the platform offers endless opportunities. Use it wisely, and you\u2019ll find yourself growing in ways you never imagined."},{"id":"/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle","source":"@site/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle.md","title":"Warranty claims explained as HTTP Requests, a developer\u2019s analogy","description":"Warranty claims in India can feel like navigating the internet with a shaky connection.

As a tech blogger and frontend developer, I thought it\u2019d be fun to break down this often frustrating yet essential consumer process using HTTP status codes as a metaphor.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What the Heck is a Warranty?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore diving in, let\'s understand the basics. Warranty is a form of consumer protection where a company promises to replace or repair a product if it malfunctions within a specified period. Think of it as a service-level agreement between you and the brand, like **12 months of uptime guarantee** for your shiny new \\"Bonda\\" mobile charger.\\r\\n\\r\\n### But It\u2019s Not Always a **200 OK**...\\r\\n\\r\\nIf companies approved every warranty claim without scrutiny, they\'d be out of business. So, they create hurdles to ensure only genuine claims get through. For us consumers, this means our warranty experience can range from seamless to outright bizarre.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims\\r\\n\\r\\n### **200 OK**: Positive Case\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consumer submits a claim with a valid invoice, and the company processes it smoothly.  \\r\\nFor example, my experience with a Transcend pen drive\'s lifetime warranty was flawless. I handed in the old one at their warehouse and walked out with a replacement. **No drama, just resolution.** I wish every claim was like this!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### **Negative Cases: 300, 400, and 500 Errors**\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **303 See Other Agency for Warranty (Outsourced)**\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of resolving your issue directly, the brand redirects you to a third-party service center. This often happens with products bought online. Hello, Amazon warranty maze!\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **304 Untouched (We\u2019re Looking Into It)**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\u2019ve submitted your claim, but the company keeps responding with, \u201cOur team will get back to you soon.\u201d Weeks pass, but nothing changes. Classic cached response with no updates.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **305 Use Proxy (Only the First Owner Gets Warranty)**\\r\\n\\r\\nSome motorcycle companies require warranty claims to be made by the original owner. If you\u2019ve bought the motorcycle second-hand, tough luck finding the first owner or kiss the warranty goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **400 Bad Request (Invalid Warranty Claim)**\\r\\n\\r\\nMisplaced your receipt? No original box? Missing serial number? Your claim is denied.  \\r\\nPro tip: Keep the computer generated bill of your purchases and warranty details in your locker.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **401 Unauthorized (You Bought It Online)**\\r\\n\\r\\nSome brands deny warranty for products bought on open-market platforms or unauthorized dealers. It\'s their way of saying, _\u201cYou didn\u2019t play by our rules.\u201d_\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **402 Payment Required (Hidden Costs)**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the product part might be under warranty, labor or transportation costs aren\u2019t. Parcel charges for small items like chargers can sometimes exceed the product\u2019s value. Talk about irony!\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **403 Forbidden (Out of Warranty Period)**\\r\\n\\r\\nYour claim is automatically rejected because you missed the warranty window. Companies rarely extend grace periods, so you\'re on your own now.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **404 Not Found (Company Disappeared)**\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline brands often vanish faster than seasonal discounts. By the time your product fails, the company\u2019s customer support or even the brand itself is nowhere to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **406 Not Acceptable (Customer-Induced Damage)**\\r\\n\\r\\nWarranty claims for damage caused by misuse are promptly denied. Spilled coffee on your laptop? Dropped your phone? The terms and conditions were crystal clear. This one\'s on you.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **408 Request Timeout (No Response from Company)**\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with valid documents, some claims are met with silence. Eventually, you lose patience and move on.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **415 Unsupported Media Type (Proof Required in Specific Formats)**\\r\\n\\r\\nSome companies require you to upload videos or images of the defect, often in specific formats. If you can\u2019t reproduce the issue on camera, your claim is stuck.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **426 Upgrade Required (Let Me Upsell You)**\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of resolving your claim, companies push you to buy a newer model. It\'s like saying, \u201cWhy fix your old phone when you can upgrade to this shiny new one?\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **500 Internal Server Error (Technicians Are Hopeless)**\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, even well-meaning customer support can\u2019t save the day because technicians are either incompetent or lack resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### **504 Gateway Timeout (Service Center Delay)**\\r\\n\\r\\nEver had a product sit in a service center for months? Delays pile up, and eventually, you\'re left chasing your own tail.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tips to Avoid Warranty Dramas\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. **Buy Smart**\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of product purchases as software development. Match your environment and reliability needs before you hit \\"Proceed to Payment\\". Check reviews and avoid flashy influencers who rave about products shortly after launch.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. **Copy Success**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your friend swears by their Maruti or Dell, consider following suit. Proven track records often mean smoother post-purchase experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. **Stay Organized**\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintain a digital or physical record of invoices and warranty documents. Think of it as a git repository for your purchases.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nClaiming a warranty in India can be as unpredictable as an HTTP request to a flaky server. From **200 OK** to **500 Internal Server Error**, your experience depends on the brand, product, and sometimes sheer luck. But with a little preparation and a lot of patience, you can improve your odds.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, warranty claims might not always bring you joy, but at least now you can laugh about them through the lens of HTTP status codes! Hope my article also clarifies if you need to buy extened warranty. That was a good tip if you read till the last line !!."},{"id":"/2024/10-takeaways-from-xconf-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10-takeaways-from-xconf-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024/10-takeaways-from-xconf-2024.md","title":"10 takeaways from xconf 2024","description":"XConf, the premier tech conference hosted by Thoughtworks, was held on November 22, 2024, at Marriott Whitefield, Bengaluru.

With over five years of experience dealing with solar heaters, both in my home and those of friends, I\'ve gathered some insights on the advantages, disadvantages, and cost savings associated with these systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater\\r\\n\\r\\n- Instant Hot Water No need to turn on the geyser and wait for it to heat up. For families with many members, this is a game-changer. My family has become accustomed to having instant hot water 24/7.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Reduced Electricity Bill Using solar energy means you save on electricity costs since you\u2019re not using the electric geyser to heat water.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Efficient Use of Solar Energy Apart from drying clothes, it\'s a great way to utilize solar energy efficiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the benefits, there are notable challenges with continuous ownership:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Water Shortages During summer, water shortages are common. If your overhead tank runs dry, the solar tank can\'t cool down, leading to cracked or broken glass tubes. If a glass tube breaks, water gushes out, potentially damaging other tubes due to the solar tank being almost empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Vacation Planning When going on vacation, ensure your overhead tank is full. If it runs dry due to evaporation, leaks, or usage, your solar heater could be damaged. Issues like monkey problems, stones, or aerial firecrackers can also break the glass tubes.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Plumbing, Tank Quality, and Hard Water The long-term success of a solar water heater depends on these factors. Hard water requires periodic servicing, which can cost around \u20b92500. Some solar tanks, made of steel alloys, can corrode and leak. The heat from the solar tank can deform pipes, so consult with plumbers about pipe quality. Hard water exacerbates these issues, damaging water-carrying devices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Cost of Investment and ROI Worries\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the numbers from my ownership, to help you with a cost-benefit analysis:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expenses\\r\\n\\r\\n2019:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Purchased Solar device: \u20b925,000\\r\\n\\r\\n- Solar piping and taps: \u20b95,000\\r\\n\\r\\n- Installation labor: \u20b95,000\\r\\n\\r\\n2023:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Glass tube replacement (1 tube): \u20b92,000\\r\\n\\r\\n- Service to remove salt every 2 years: \u20b93,000\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintenance Costs:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Every 2 years: \u20b94,000 for upkeep and salt removal\\r\\n\\r\\n- Every 10 years: \u20b920,000 for plumbing overhaul\\r\\n\\r\\n- Additional expenses due to unexpected damage: \u20b910,000\\r\\n\\r\\nExpected Product Life: 20 years\\r\\n\\r\\nIssues faced in 5 years: Tank leak, broken glass tube, unfriendly service personnel, and uncooperative dealer.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Potential Savings\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual Electricity Bill Savings: \u20b96,000 (\u20b9500\\\\*12)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Financial Summary\\r\\n\\r\\n- Cost of Ownership in 20 years: \u20b9105,000 (approx.)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Potential Savings: \u20b9120,000 (approx.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo recover the costs, avoid repairs due to water scarcity, monkey problems, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the pros and cons are nearly balanced, the convenience of having hot water readily available is a significant advantage. Purchase solar heaters from reputable dealers and ensure they provide good after-sales service. Many brands are local with informal dealer networks, so check their service commitment beforehand. For instance, a reputed brand might have only one service person for all of Bangalore and nearby districts."},{"id":"/2024/google-genai-exchange-developer-day-2024-good-parts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/google-genai-exchange-developer-day-2024-good-parts","source":"@site/blog/2024/google-genai-exchange-developer-day-2024-good-parts.md","title":"Google GenAI Developer Day Bangalore 2024 Learnings","description":"Gen AI Dev Day","date":"2024-09-04T08:30:30.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"conferences","permalink":"/blog/tags/conferences"},{"inline":true,"label":"GenAI","permalink":"/blog/tags/gen-ai"}],"readingTime":2.99,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Google GenAI Developer Day Bangalore 2024 Learnings","tags":["conferences","GenAI"],"date":"2024-09-04T08:30:30.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Solar Water Heaters Pros, Cons, and Savings Calculations in 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/3-reasons-not-to-buy-solar-water-heater-india"},"nextItem":{"title":"React Nexus 2024, Good Parts.

I call them good parts of React Nexus 2024. I add my commentary along the way. Hope you like it and read all the way from good parts #1 to #100.\\n\\n## Good Parts\\n\\n### Venue & Arragements\\n\\n1. The selection of [React Nexus 2024 Venue](https://reactnexus.com/#venue) was Apt, not just easy for attendees but also in line with react nexus 2023 venue. Radison Blu Marathahalli is our 2 day adda (means a social gathering or hangout spot).\\n\\n2. The rockstars of the conference, the speakers were simply meritorious and profound. The full list along with their linkedin and X handles can be found on [React Nexus Speakers Section](https://reactnexus.com/#speakers) \\n\\n3. The conference vibe was kindled by a giant screen resembling a movie theatre and JBL speakers playing [deep dope beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA-ChrNuyO0&pp=ygUPZGVlcCBkb3BlIG11c2lj). Further momentum was added by [charismatic emcees](https://reactnexus.com/#mcs) who knew tech and humour.\\n\\n4. The conference goodies included an name card tag, tshirt which is true to its size variant and few stickers. Minimalistic and useful.\\n\\n5. The overall conference was jam packed with surprises like traditional yakshagana dance, activities which felt like cardio & desk yoga, standup comedy, Bhangra dance which resembled flash mob, timely coffee and great food.\\n\\n### Day 1 of React Nexus 2024\\n\\n6. The first speaker was Naman Goel, spoke about \\"Designing for design: API decisions for long-term success\\". Naman is a maintainer at [StyleX JS](https://stylexjs.com/) at Meta. He spoke about the design decisions, importance of inspiration and lineage in developing libraries and quick demos of stylex.\\n\\n7. Finish your side project to be successful. I do not think this needs any explaination. Simple advice yet profound.\\n\\n8. React was inspired by functional programming so hooks were inevitable and a natural progression. The same inspiration is a hidden force in stylex JS as well.\\n\\n9. Evolution of ReactJS be like.. React create class --\x3e JSX --\x3e Real classes --\x3e Functional Components --\x3e hooks --\x3e React server components..\\n\\n10. Conference talk idea. \\"Algebraic effects\\". This is a react concept which is discussed on [Dan Blog](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/) and referenced in Naman Goel speech.\\n\\n11. Trade offs help us to reach the sweet spot in design decisions. I cant agree more, without tradeoff programming would be simply hard for many.\\n\\n12. React fiber underwent a complete rewrite 8 years ago due to which we are able to add further enhancements to React like hooks, React Server Components (RSC), etc. Its always a good value add to hear directly from maintainers at Meta.\\n\\n13. The second speaker Nurul Sundarani, spoke about \\"Beyond the Backend: The Rise of React Server Components\\". He gave a lightning introduction to React Server Components (RSC in short) and how we can use them with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started).\\n\\n14. In the era of RSC, every frontend developer will be a fullstack developer too. Tools like Prisma should help you with that transformation.\\n\\n15. RSC can directly talk to databases, render only on the server so they can have API keys, good for SEO as the HTML and CSS alone can add value to the web crawlers, make the website quick by avoiding render fetch, etc.. The list goes on. Bottomline learn RSC ASAP. Good for you and your business.\\n\\n16. The third speaker Akash Hamirwasia, spoke about \\"Enhancing your Static Sites with React Server Components\\". Yes, RSC can be used on the static website. Sounds contrary? then read on.\\n\\n17. [Static websites](https://akashhamirwasia.com/) too run on a server and RSC can make use of the file server to do more. I was not able to find the code on Speaker Github but you need to know that its a possibility to do RSC on static websites.\\n\\n18. I was impressed with ease and confidence with which the relatively young speaker Akash was able to put his point across the room. While I was watching his speech, I was convinced without a doubt. Bottomline, the speaker had exceeding levels of communications skills and confidence. Sometimes you pick up a thing or two non tech skills in a tech conference.\\n\\n19. The fourth speaker Stefinie Fernando spoke about \\"Building Secure React Apps with Choreo IDevP\\". The software Choreo had some similarity with GCP app engine. In choreo the role of the developer ends with commiting code and packaging app into a image. The rest is taken care by Choreo platform.\\n\\n20. The Choreo platform boasts of complete software development cycle support ranging from CI/CD to deployment on a cluster. To playaround, visit [Choreo website](https://wso2.com/choreo/).\\n\\n21. Next JS which is a react framework has good levels of RSC support. Other react frameworks like remix are not behind. Think RSC, think react frameworks. RSC have friends too, they are called React server actions. `use server` directive, heard of it?\\n\\n> If there were one word that was repeated a lot during react nexus 2024, it would be RSC\\n\\n22. The fourth speaker Vamshi Suram spoke about \\"Scalable mock data injection into Apollo (GraphQL) Client\\". Overall the speaker was confortable on stage talking about his open source project [apollo-mock-http](https://github.com/intuit/apollo-mock-http) which helps us with data mocking even in enterprise level applications.\\n\\n23. Mocking should be done away from application layer so that they can be toggled with a feature switch. This is not advice specific to apollo client but frontend in general. I like this application design pattern. \\n\\n24. Good mocking should not hinder or interfere with UI rendering because you loose out on the UI interactivity and animation. This advice is given with the context of react components where devs set data to props directly to mock the data.\\n\\n25. The fifth speaker Sweta Tanwar spoke about \\"Defensive Development: Testing Tactics for React Native Resilience\\". This was the first speech referencing React Native in React Nexus 2024. The content was actionable and could easily be blown up into a full book. \\n\\n26. Defensive application development can be broken into 3 categories. Code practices, Testing and CI/CD automation. More details in the next thread.\\n\\n27. Code practices include code quality checks, error handling with graceful degradation and error boundaries, component isolation before testing\\n\\n28. Testing practices include Unit testing with Jest, Integration testing with Enzyme and E2E testing with Detox/Appium. On react we are mostly talking about React testing with Vitest and playwright testing.\\n\\n29. The pyramid visualization was used to show that an app needs more unit tests which are efficient and integration testing at the top of the pyramid which are comprehensive. The pyramid slide will be referenced in my future discussions with architects on why unit, e2e and integration.\\n\\n30. CI/CD automation of tests can be done to catch regression issues in a automated fashion. We can use tools like circle CI, Travis, etc.\\n\\n31. The Sixth Speaker Rajat Vijay spoke about \\"Experiments with AI-Generated Tests\\". I see the testing theme, pre lunch to be a good idea. Good job organizers. I can sense that Rajat has seen good amount of tests in his career. He clearly outlined the problem with Copilot generated tests and how he intends to fix them.\\n\\n32. Rajat mentioned a tool titled \\"auto guardian\\" which instructs AI tools about the expected quality and style of testing. It looks like a config file for AI testing. I feel this would bring uniformity in the AI testing.\\n\\n33. Rajat spilled a few interview questions. userEvent vs fireEvent? Whats the difference and which is better. getByRole vs getByText. I will write a blog about these topics soon\\n\\n34. Rajat referenced https://www.promptingguide.ai/ to understand more about writing better prompts. I believe the future auto guardian would refer to these prompting standards.\\n\\n35. The testing demo was fun to watch and clearly the quality of tests can be increased greatly. The link to github repo is broken. Rajat plz toggle the repo to public if its private.\\n\\n36. The seventh speaker were from freshworks, spoke about \\"AI-Assisted Development: Harnessing the Freshworks Freddy Copilot Toolkit for App Development\\". The second sponsor speech on day 1. Its interested to see the no code movement gaining steam. Developers can build a full fledged application with a few apps and monetise on the platform. Thats insane.\\n\\n37. The Freedy Copilot had lot of similarities with github copilot. It needed registration, installation on vs code, type your requirement on chat. Freedy can also deploy to their marketplace. Finally no code app generation is in reach / at times free to use.\\n\\n38. The different stages from an idea to app. Requirements gathering, design, implemenation & refactoring, testing can be handled by Freedy.\\n\\n39. Freedy can also build UI for the developers based on the prompt. frontend engineers, gulp it down. Yes AI can build UI. Freedy relies on vision models for generating UI for freshworks marketplace.\\n\\n40. The engineering behind Freedy copilot was also discussed by second presenter Nagaraj. All I could injest into my mind were LLM, AI and more of it. Finally Day 1 Lunch hour.\\n\\n41. The post lunch first session featured a panel discussion comprising none other than the react core team from meta, how cool is that. We had Satya talk about the working on React compiler. Yes I heard it for the first time. I know only about React fiber but React compiler is a thing. True to its name, it compiles your react app into something sophisticated.\\n\\n42. The react compiler could potentially free us from writing useMemo and useCallback as the compiler could do better code optimization compared to a normal developer. However if the compiler identifies a tricky code or hacky code, it will assume that developer is the best judge and shall not mess with it.\\n\\n43. In React 19, ref is a regular prop. I hope to miss forwardExoticComponentRef in my life.\\n\\n44. There was a short and sweet answer to breaking changes, if you had been following the modern standards of react development. Then there are no breaking changes that should bother you. So legacy app developers brace yourself, modern app developers rejoice and upgrade to react 19.\\n\\n45. eslint plugin for react is now updated and optimized for react compiler. However there are many bugs that could escape the eslint and get inferred by React compiler. Code better and do not just trust eslint for react.\\n\\n46. React Strict DOM (RSD) is an integration of React DOM and StyleX, aiming to streamline and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native targets. We had Stylex maintainer Naman Goel talk about the possibilities of RSD.\\n\\n47. The conversation quickly moved towards RSC (React Server Components) best practices. Don\'t waste time hydrating components that are not read/used.\\n\\n48. Render as you fetch or fetch as you render? An another interview question to note. The panel favoured Render as you fetch as mentioned this is how apps to be built be it RSC or RN\\n\\n49. use operator is used for reading resources outside of the render. However it being a panel discussion, no demo or code was shown about the use operator. An another speech topic for potential speakers.\\n\\n50. The road ahead for react team looks like this. Compilation improvements, eslint plugin updates, lot of tooling related work is expected. I remember panel mentioning NextJS, Remix, etc. The panel discussion felt short but Tapas (the moderator) was well prepared with sharp questions.\\n\\n51. The eighth speaker Prateek Surana spoke about \\"Elevate your routing game with TanStack Router\\". Definitely I felt slightly outdated or an idiot for not use tanstack router after his demo. The power and relevance for enterprise use cases were amazing and would prevent developers from reinventing the wheel around routing.\\n\\n52. Tanstack router is file based, which is easy to understand and relatively hard to scale. To me the most killer feature was auto filter param rename in runtime. Let us say if param was misspelled, tanstack query can correct it for us without breaking the application\\n\\n53. The overall tanstack tools are squarely built around scaled react usecases which is beyond a simple ecommerce use case. I recommend checking out other tanstack tools and I am also excited to see how the tanstack fullstack comes out to be.\\n\\n54. The nineth speaker Palak Bansal spoke about \\"Mastering Image Optimization Techniques for Web Performance in React Applications\\". Let us face it, images can be hard to optimize and Addy osmani has written a book about it. Palak rightly hit the nail on the head by telling \\"Best practices keep changing which makes image optimization harder\\"\\n\\n55. Broadly there are 3 image optimization techniques that were discussed. They are lazy loading, responsive  images and image CDN.\\n\\n56. Lazy loading can be done on the <img/> tag with a attribute called lazy. The responsive images can be based on width of the client or pixel density of the client. Image cdn can be self managed or third party cdn which generate images on the fly specially for the client\\n\\n57. If you are wondering if the talk around image optimization is not as comprehensive as [Addy Osmani](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/image-optimization-pre-release/) book, you are right. This is a small talk format, some speeches are smaller than others.\\n\\n58. The tenth speaker Jerad Rutnam spoke about \\"Simplify React App Login\\". The reasons for having a login feature are access control and personalization. But having a solid authentication logic can be hard and there were the sponsor of the event pitched his humble React component which was part of [Asgardeo sdk](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/)\\n\\n59. As part of Asgardeo team, the recommendation from Jerad was to delegate complex parts of the app and focus on business logic implementation which could be your goto market strategy. Cannot deny if everyone had good budget, flexibility in the code and restrictions around data.\\n\\n60. The eleventh speaker Apurv Khare spoke about \\"Flashpoint Performance\\". Is that even a thing or library or concept? Before I could stop wondering, the speaker was sprinting at the speed of flash with his speech. Lots of concepts discussed and I had tough time writing down the ideas from his speech. But the speaker knew his tools and he explained with confidence.\\n\\n61. Measure performance first and optimize later. The speaker took us through different categories of performance metrics like Browser metrics, Core web vitals, Lab data & Field data. The optimization techniques include compression techniques, optimizing JS, optimizing CSS, resource hints and optimized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). \\n\\n62. The speaker idea was to give a crash course on measure performance and also optimizing the performance with some numbers/reports from the tools wherever required. But I do not think the speaker showed us any tool called flashpoint.\\n\\n63. Browser metrics - Time To First Byte (TTFB), Speed Index. Core web vitals / User experience metrics - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Latest Shift (CLS)\\n\\n64. Here are some of the tools to measure website performance. App run at lab condition / lab data - Lighthouse, webpage test. App run at field condition / field data - Chrome UX report (CrUX), Pagespeed insights\\n\\n65. The network waterfall was well discussed with webpageTest and web vitals were discussed. The important performance concept, Critical Rendering Path was discussed. Of course, the speaker mentioned how CSSOM is built and how its different from JS DOM.\\n\\n66. Website performance testing on first load vs repeat load was interesting to me because we generally measure the first load only. Wherever flat text files or documents are served from server to client, we must enable one of the gzip, brottli or other compression techniques\\n\\n67. For optimizing JS - Pause blocking JS, defer it as much as possible. For Optimizing CSS - download CSS ASAP on the device in one chunk so that CSSOM gets built and the user can see the content rendered. Use resource hints like rel, as to pre load the content before it gets used. When prefetching multiple resources, use fetch priority.\\n\\n68. The day 1 post noon, performance speeches continue. The 12th speaker and last speaker of the day was Saurabh Daware and he spoke about \\"Debugging Performance Issues of Your Website\\". The previous speech was theoretical and this speech was practical to the best.\\n\\n69. Performance issues are like any other bugs, for debugging performance issues just do not put a break point. The first place to look for is the network waterfall whenever we face an issue.\\n\\n70. The speaker was running a static site featuring Razorpay landing page, he demonstrated First Contentful Paint and Last Contentful Paint. The speaker attempted to showcase perceived performance optimization and how his attempted interfered with other metrics like LCP.\\n\\n71. The speaker showcased how he cleverly chose to improve the perceived performance by booting the webcontainer only when code gets focus, until that point he shows the static output which gives the user the perception of fast. Its kind of fake it until you make it logic.\\n\\n### Day 2 of React Nexus 2024\\n\\n72. Day 2 felt somewhat slow to me as we did not waste time at registration desk. But things took a turn when we begun the day 2 with a lightening talk about Yoga. The speaker gave a mini talk focussed on breathing, expanding spine length and some posture correction tips. We need to take 10 minutes a day to see the difference.\\n\\n73. The key exercises mentioned were neck stretches, breathing slow and deep, shoulder roll, cat cow pose while sitting. If you are yoga geek, then Tadasana and Garudasana were mentioned. If you feel stiff like wood, then remember range of motion increases with consistency.\\n\\n74. The 13th speaker Alex Lobera spoke about \\"Future-proofing state management at scale\\". He showcased the app he works on \\"Miro\\" and there is definitely lot of user state, sync state happening in the app. The app looks like scrum board and renders on canvas/webGL based on the client.\\n\\n75. The author somehow connected the PHP era with RSC era. We were essentially connecting to DB and building UI all in one php file. We are doing the same in RSC. Just the server was not in the picture during SPA era and now its back. Congrats, everyone is now a full stack engineer.\\n\\n76. Client can access server state but server cannot access client state. The server is coming back to the picture, this time its different. The server can help us build a state in RSC era. fyi day 2 had lot of speakers flying into India for the conference. Alex was from Portugal.\\n\\n77. The 14th speaker Tapas Adhikary spoke about \\"Do You Really Need React Query For Your Applications?\\". I was one of the user of React Query and I got hooked. The real threat to React Query was change in context due to RSC. Now the client can talk to DB directly. However for complex use cases we might still need tanstack query.\\n\\n78. The 15th speaker K Kamalakannan spoke about \\"Simplifying Complex Logic: Leveraging XState in React Development\\". I appreciate the state machine part, orchestration and visualization aspect of XState.\\n\\n79. The 16th speaker Ankit Tailor spoke about \\"How I built a Powerful Typed System?\\". He had worked on a design sytem called gluestack where he has authored CSS in JS which needs to be type safe. I could appreciate the use case for generic data types in designing type systems.\\n\\n80. The speaker mentions different aspects of DX like linting, debugging tools, typescript type checks and he showcased a CLI diagnostic tool which could show the size of generated types file which is absolutely needed for performance reasons. npx tsc --diagnostics \\n\\n81. The 16th and 17th speaker were Mike Grabowski & Eric Vicenti speaking about a new paradigm \\"How you can Server-Render without Rendering on the Server\\". At the core we are trying to use web sockets to communicate with client UI on realtime to render changes. The use case was showcases interactively like a theatre play by 2 speaker on the stage with live coding.\\n\\n82. The speakers showcased their npm component library which could react to our code listening via WS protocol. The links to the code or library cannot be found on google. Watch out for [rise.tools](https://rise.tools/). Not just the rendering library, rise.tools also has a component library so that developers can quickly build apps along with a playground.\\n\\n83. The 18th speaker Sanket Sahu spoke about \\"Building Back-End Driven Universal Apps\\". Conceptually Sanket is attempting to solve the same problem as Mike & Eric. Instead of too much code which looks like config. We have syntactically simpler code which can be generated by chatgpt to a very high level of accuracy. Thats in line with no code development of the future.\\n\\n84. The 19th speaker Shruti Arya spoke about \\"Measuring UI performance at scale\\". The talk was mostly about React native app on low end android devices. The github project was called component-profiler. Surprisingly I could not catch hold of the link to it. The goal was to prevent long re-renders so that there is no jankiness.\\n\\n85. The 20th speaker Santosh Yadav spoke about \\"Improve your Developer Experience with Nx\\". When the pain point that Nx tries to fill was lengthy build times on any machine, be it CI/CD or cloud or local. The NX tool intelligently creates a graph of the code and precisely knows the impact of the code change. Then runs the required build tasks instead of running every single build step on the entire code base.\\n\\n86. The 21st speaker Apoorv Taneja spoke about \\"Creating beautiful experiences with Framer-Motion on web\\". [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) helps anyone without indepth css knowledge build animations. The speaker precisely showed us how to use framer to create interactivity on the UI components.\\n\\n87. The 22nd speaker Yashpreet Bathla spoke about \\"Avoid flickering user interfaces\\". The presentation deck resembled windows 95 and it was amazing. The speaker explained the concepts like call stack, micro task queue, macro task queue and render queue in detail. He also mentioned the need to maintain 60FPS, and one render in 16.6ms to have a jank free interface. He also showed how using useLayoutEffect helps in preventing jankiness when compared to useEffect\\n\\n88. The 23rd speaker Mohit Kumar Toshniwal spoke about \\"Building XR applications using React Three Fiber\\". As speaker rightly said, the AR/VR usage has increased. Be it shopping on amazon or navigating with google maps. We can build AR/VR apps in react with react three fiber, drei, leva, react-xr etc\\n\\n89. Then a panel discussion follows but this time the theme is state of react native. Panelists mentioned that react native is yet to reach v1.0.0. The expo eco system is quite mature and visiting expo.new is the way to get started with React native.\\n\\n90. The 24th speaker Neha Sharma spoke about \\"Connecting Worlds: Enhancing Accessibility in React Native TV Applications\\". Her talk was more about building accessible react native apps for smart TVs. On the mobile, the accessible is missing unlike accessible semantic html. This calls for more empathy from react native developers. The attributes like accessible are must have to make app accessible on TVs. The speaker reiterated that accessiblity is hard, its not a requirement but a feature to have.\\n\\n91. The 25th speaker Siddharth Kshetrapal spoke about Building accessible reusable react components. Having worked at primer.style, he is proficient in comprehending accessiblity issues and uses his tech speaker skills to make it interesting and understandable to audience. The speaker used 2 commonly used github widgets and tried to make them accessible.\\n\\n92. Siddharth referenced the importance of [APG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) over WCAG in some use cases. he cleverly used the voice over to illustrate the pain, which the disabled people undergo due to our incorrect coding. I was thrilled and hooked to this speech, will certain share this speech to A11 enthusiasts.\\n\\n### Other wonders from React Nexus 2024\\n\\n93. I watched the react documentary trailer for the first time and happy to see the people behind React and the collective team spirit. You should watch it too, I mean the full video on youtube titled [\\"How A Small Team of Developers Created React at Facebook | React.js: The Documentary\\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44).\\n\\n94. The sponsors were unintrusive, I was not bored by their presence on the stage or at the booth. Both of them answered the questions earnestly. The Freedy developer, aka AI tool for freshworks marketplace developers booth at the conference was showering goodies to the successful quiz winners and they had a lucky draw too.\\n\\n95. The Asgardio platform which is a simple managed Authentication platform for developers conducted a workshop post the day 1 session which I felt was a generous  offering for attendees. The choreo platform which was an another stall was a useful utility for individual developers and small teams who want to have managed backend service. I love their stickers and pens kept for visitors. \\n\\n96. The audience were diverse in terms of demographics and their roots. Some of them were from students at Scalar academy, managers at Microsoft, founders of companies and in between. The Javascript community is quite strong like a giant multinational company having its subsidaries for their interests. We have JS Lovers, Chennai React, Delhi React, React Day Bangalore, team shiksha, etc\\n\\n97. Emcee Jobs are hardest and demands Charisma. Aakansha Doshi was simply bold and energetic. The cardio session to beat the sleep was a masterstroke by Aakansha.\\n\\n98. From timely humor to manager jokes, the second emcee Sahil Kalyani was equally charismatic on the stage. The third emcee Yashraj Nayak, whom I would remember for \\"how is the josh\\" was unique. He had deep connections with speakers and he was able to discuss some enjoyable anecdotes from his experience working with the speaker. Lastly \\"How is the Josh?\\"\\n\\n100. The one last thing would be the presentation aids prepared by the tech speakers were spellbound. I would appeciate the amount of time, thought and content the speakers have put into the presentations aids / PPT material. I could not differentiate if its online editor or powerpoint tools or excalidraw or just 10x creative powers of the speakers who were frontend engineers.\\n\\nThats enough about react nexus and my commentary on React nexus 2024, have a good day."},{"id":"/2024/observations-on-amazon-prime-as-a-seller","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/observations-on-amazon-prime-as-a-seller","source":"@site/blog/2024/observations-on-amazon-prime-as-a-seller.md","title":"Is Amazon Prime Saving Delivery Charges?

Treat the below article as an education material only.\\n\\nOn Amazon marketplace, the delivery charges or logistics charges are unavoidable because the amazon products are to be delivered to the customer by Amazon itself. \\n\\n## Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly \\n\\nAmazon marketplace makes money from both sides. \\n\\n1. Money from Customers who buy on Amazon\\n2. Money from Sellers who sell on Amazon\\n\\nThis is when things turn awry for me. As a seller I pay delivery charges based on multiple factors like location of the seller and how far the location is relative to the seller location. As a seller I have no visibility on if the customer is a prime member or not. Neither any discounts on prime are shown to me. As a seller, I have to factor in the delivery charges in the MRP or collect separate delivery fees. As a amazon prime member if I buy the product, I am already paying for the delivery charge which is factored into the pricing by the seller. \\n\\nIf a non amazon prime member does the purchase below the threshold, then the amazon customer has to pay delivery charges twice because the seller has already factored in, the delivery charges along with the cost price and profit.\\n\\nBut Amazon prime members are not really given any \\"Free Delivery\\" as promised, its just a waive off of an platform charge associated with Amazon. The 1499 per year is not a discount voucher for delivery charges. In fact, you might have noticed that some products are less than 50 INR in physical stores like pens but on Amazon they are 150Rs etc because of the delivery charges.\\n\\nOverall the delivery charges are unavoidable on any ecommerce platform and diminishes the value of the sales if the shopper is not careful. To be careful, the shopper need to be aware of the prices in the real world.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n1. Both Amazon Prime and Non Prime members bear the shipping charges directly and indirectly\\n2.

In tech companies, the personnel are called resources. The army trains in camps and carries weapons. Resources work in offices, GCC, and carry laptops. In 2020 due to covid pandemic outbreak, the resources were asked to work from home. Thats how the resources experienced work from home lifestyle, the episode started. Fast forward 2024, the resources are asked to leave behind the work from home and come back to office marking the end of episode work from home, lovingly called the WFH.\\n\\nSome companies went the extra mile and allowed the resources to work from anywhere forever. In a similar time frame, I wrote an article about [work from home vs remote working](https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working#what-is-the-difference-between-wfh-and-remote-working). The key takeaway was that working from home was a temporary fix unless the company adopted the culture mentioned in the book [Remote, Office Not Required](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-remote-office-not-required/).\\n\\nFast forward to the start of 2024, almost all companies have given a first call, second call, or in some cases, a final call asking resources to get back to working from the office. This means that the comfort of working from home and the associated lifestyle is no more. But there have to be a few reasons why the back-to-office movement is happening. Of course, there are many reasons; here are a few as quoted by management.\\n\\n## Reasons to get back to the office\\n\\n1. Covid is out of the picture; we can get back to the old way of working from the office. Our senior management is already doing it.\\n2. Operating in silos or as small teams won\'t boost the morale of the team or the culture of the company.\\n3. Use the office as a space to build your personal brand.\\n4. Please come to the office and use the building; we have purchased or leased it already for the long term. We have made it better in the recent renovation.\\n5. The economy depends on your return to the office; the cab drivers, janitors, and realtors need you.\\n\\nIf you ask me, except for the first reason, the others should not be taken seriously.\\n\\n## How management is pulling resources back to the office\\n\\n1. The company-wide call announcing mandatory work from the office for a minimum of 3 days.\\n2. Check if employees have punched into the office for a minimum of 3 days or 50% of working days.\\n3. Bring in a policy that allows reduced pay for people working remotely.\\n4. Bring in another policy that values presence in the office. No promotion if not working from the office. Personally, this statement is dangerous. Companies pay higher salaries to retain employees and not out of obligation. Having said that, more salary reduction could mean being on the layoff list.\\n5. In-office meetings and not having the option for online participation from WFH resources.\\n\\n## My reaction to the back-to-office episode\\n\\n1. In late 2020, after analyzing the implementation of WFH, it was clear that this was a temporary arrangement.\\n2. I condemn the press statements and town hall speeches by the management of tech companies in favor of working from anywhere. Everyone believed that working from home would continue forever.\\n3. Later in 2023, the management was the first to step into the office, followed by their immediate teams. This set an example for the whole company that working from the office is the way to conduct business.\\n4. Working from the office could mean perks like team lunches and client visits happening soon. Good for those with passports ready.\\n5. Companies need to be mindful about the transition and set the deadlines accordingly. Some employees were working in their pyjamas for long hours at home. In the work-from-office arrangement, they will waste time commuting, etc.\\n6. I am surprised when no management person said that working from the office is an opportunity for osmosis of ideas, easy to mentor juniors, or have fun moments. It looks like none of these happen at the workplace anymore or have been forgotten because of insufficient use.\\n\\n## Don\'t go to extremes\\n\\nOne person got into an argument where he refused to take the laptop home in the work-from-office arrangement, which led to tensions at the workplace. Accept that no system is perfect and software has bugs. In a long career span of 40 years, anything can happen.

Recently, I stumbled upon a job posting from [Amazon Bangalore for the position of Design Technologist](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3812056674/?alternateChannel=search&refId=Dz%2BIExfUI9357n%2BKI2VWsA%3D%3D&trackingId=lY7zJQJjL%2Bd6EeIWSGrk8Q%3D%3D). As a lead design technologist, I feel compelled to delve into the contours of this intriguing job opportunity.\\n\\n## Contour of the Job\\n\\n**Location**: Bangalore\\n\\n**Company**: Amazon\\n\\n**Department**: Amazon Ads Design Team\\n\\n**Subjects**: Digital Advertising, Multi-channel Ads, E-commerce\\n\\n**Position**: Design Technologist\\n\\n**Team**: Design Leaders\\n\\n## Defining Design Technologist\\n\\nThe role of a design technologist lacks a universally accepted definition in the job market, prompting the Amazon recruiter to articulate their interpretation. As a Design Technologist at Amazon, one is expected to strike a balance between technical execution and design strategy, contributing to the creation of innovative landing pages and digital ad solutions. The ideal candidate possesses a passion for both design and development, demonstrating strong front-end proficiency, creative problem-solving skills, and a discerning eye for world-class functional design.\\n\\n> TLDR: Design and Technical Leadership = Design Technologist\\n\\nThe core attributes of a design technologist encompass conveying design strategy through code, proficiency in front-end technologies, UX patterns, and best practices, building prototypes with vanilla JS and CSS, attention to detail in library maintenance, and the ability to work on multiple projects while creatively solving business challenges.\\n\\n## Job Requirements\\n\\nThe Amazon recruiter has outlined several unique requirements for the design technologist role:\\n\\n- Web development experience across multiple devices, web-views, and browsers.\\n- Delivery of functional prototypes on new devices.\\n- Full participation in the lifecycle of design and development.\\n- Inclusion of an online portfolio with process examples.\\n- Ability to develop ad campaign strategy, use cases, and technical requirements.\\n\\n## Qualifications\\n\\nBeyond the common prerequisites such as end-to-end ownership and web/mobile app development experience, the unique qualifications include:\\n\\n- Development of visually polished, engaging, and highly fluid UX prototypes using Figma/Sketch.\\n- Previous experience in complex UI animations, with an emphasis on understanding webGL, React Spring, and Framer Motion.\\n- Familiarity with Tensorflow and ThreeJS, along with prior experience as a UX/Interaction designer.\\n\\n## My Observation\\n\\nThe job requirements clearly emphasize mastery in frontend development, design, and UI with a focus on animations. An ideal candidate may have undergone a career transition from UX to Frontend or vice versa at some point. This role may not align with the skill set of full-stack engineers.\\n\\nRigorous preparation is paramount for applicants aiming to stand out in a competitive landscape. The scarcity of job openings necessitates a 10x effort in interview preparation, with priority often given to candidates from top colleges, those with resumes from reputed companies, and those with referrals. Design technologist roles demand intensive preparation, as exemplified by the specifics outlined in the discussed Amazon job posting.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn a scenario where job openings are scarce, candidates must elevate their interview preparation to tenfold levels due to heightened competition. The discussed design technologist job at Amazon provides a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities, qualifications, and desirable skills, serving as a guide for professionals aspiring to thrive in this specialized field.\\n\\n## Reference\\n\\n[Amazon Bangalore, Design Technologist Job Ad](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3812056674/?alternateChannel=search&refId=Dz%2BIExfUI9357n%2BKI2VWsA%3D%3D&trackingId=lY7zJQJjL%2Bd6EeIWSGrk8Q%3D%3D)"},{"id":"/2024/insights-from-job-boards-week2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/insights-from-job-boards-week2","source":"@site/blog/2024/insights-from-job-boards-week2.md","title":"Insights from Principle Frontend Job Descriptions - Week 2, 2024","description":"Welcome back to our ongoing series, \\"Insights from Job Boards.\\" In this week\'s edition, we delve into the crucial job market requirements for senior-level Frontend Managers.

One recurring issue that has cost me money on multiple occasions is the use of standing instructions for payments, where entering credit card details during free trials can lead to unforeseen financial consequences. In this blog post, I will share three instances where standing instructions resulted in financial loss and discuss strategies to mitigate these risks.\\n\\n## Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator\\n\\n> Same can happen on any cloud services aggregator\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\'s free tier is a playground for developers, offering a range of services to experiment with. However, the requirement to enter credit card information exposes users to potential financial risks. Some dormant services can accumulate bills, and unpaid amounts accrue interest at a hefty 30% per annum. To avoid an unpleasant surprise, it is crucial for developers to actively monitor their Google Cloud billing section, even when services are in a dormant stage. While setting budgets can help control costs, it\'s imperative to note that alerts alone may not prevent services from running over the set limit.\\n\\n## Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap\\n\\nManaging media consumption subscriptions can be challenging, especially when juggling multiple platforms. To optimize costs, my family cycles through apps every two months to watch all available titles without paying for them simultaneously. The challenge lies in remembering to cancel subscriptions before they auto-renew. Forgetting to do so results in wasted money. Vigilance and regular subscription audits are essential to avoid unnecessary charges.\\n\\n## Overcharging after Subscription Renewal\\n\\nYearly renewing subscriptions often come with an unwelcome surprise\u2014the increased subscription price. Unfortunately, standing instructions automatically accept the higher cost, even if the renewed service may no longer be worth the investment. To prevent this, it\'s crucial to reassess the value of the service before allowing standing instructions to renew it automatically.\\n\\n## How to Avoid Unwanted Charges\\n\\n1. Maintain a Detailed Record: Create and regularly update an Excel sheet containing all websites where you\'ve authorized standing instructions for payments. This centralized record will serve as a quick reference and aid in monitoring financial commitments.\\n\\n2. Stay Informed: Actively monitor notifications and emails related to payments and billing. Ignoring these alerts can lead to unintended financial consequences. Stay informed to take timely action. In India we have sihub website where we can see all the autopay instructions in one place.\\n\\n3. Seek Remedies: In case of discrepancies or unexpected charges, don\'t hesitate to seek help from customer support. Engage with the respective platforms to find a suitable remedy, which might include closing an account or modifying standing instructions.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs a techie, navigating the world of standing instructions requires diligence and strategic planning. By learning from my experiences with Google Cloud, media subscriptions, and renewal surprises, you can implement proactive strategies to avoid financial losses.

Enter DSR, or Developer Social Responsibility, a concept akin to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) undertaken by companies.\\n\\nTraditionally, major corporations like Tata Consultancy Services (TCSL) allocate a portion of their resources towards community-centric initiatives through CSR. In a similar vein, I, as a developer, am embarking on a novel journey \u2013 utilizing my platform to craft posts that serve the local community or residents of my locality. The underlying ethos of DSR is to provide valuable information that may not be readily available in the public domain, thereby bridging knowledge gaps and fostering a sense of community support.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Principles of DSR Posts:\\n\\n1. **Conciseness is Key:**\\n   DSR posts will embody brevity without compromising on substance. By distilling information into concise and digestible content, the aim is to deliver maximum value in a minimal timeframe. This ensures that readers can easily assimilate the information and apply it to their lives.\\n\\n2. **Positive Tone:**\\n   DSR posts will steer clear of a complaining or negative tone. The objective is to inspire and uplift, offering solutions and insights that empower readers rather than dwelling on issues. This positive approach not only resonates better with the audience but also aligns with the constructive spirit of social responsibility.\\n\\n3. **Limited Social Media Promotion:**\\n   Unlike conventional blog posts that often rely heavily on social media channels for promotion, DSR posts will take a different route. By abstaining from aggressive promotion on platforms, the focus remains on organic reach and genuine engagement. This approach ensures that the content reaches those genuinely interested in community-centric information.\\n\\nIn adopting the DSR framework, the intention is clear: to create content that transcends the digital realm and makes a tangible impact on the lives of individuals within the community. This initiative seeks to foster a sense of responsibility among developers, urging them to leverage their skills and knowledge for the betterment of society.\\n\\nAs the DSR journey unfolds, the commitment to concise, positive, and community-centric content remains steadfast. By embracing this unique approach, developers can play an active role in shaping a more informed, empowered, and connected society, one blog post at a time."},{"id":"/2024/10-things-principal-frontend-job-boards-W1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10-things-principal-frontend-job-boards-W1","source":"@site/blog/2024/10-things-principal-frontend-job-boards-W1.md","title":"Insights from Senior Frontend Engineers Job Descriptions - Week 1, 2024","description":"In the dynamic world of software development, staying ahead of the curve is crucial for success.

This one\'s dedicated to my fellow bachelor employee countrymen who are navigating the complexities of finances without a strategy. Remember you need money from even before you are born and after you are dead.\\n\\n> TLDR: This article is my last blog article about financial planning for bachelor techies in India.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Types:\\n\\nI\'ve observed that bachelor techies can be broadly classified into two types:\\n\\n**Type 1:** No Debt\\n\\n**Type 2:** Have Debt\\n\\nLet us assume your salary is 100 INR in your bank account, how to allocate salary of 100 INR? Now, let\'s delve into the nitty-gritty of an ideal financial plan based on your type.\\n\\n> Depending on your salary, you may adjust the percentage split but ensure you have plan to send money into each category.\\n\\n### Type 1: No Debt\\n\\nFor those fortunate enough to have no outstanding commitments, allocating your salary wisely is relatively simple:\\n\\nFirst Batch - Investment\\n\\n1. 15Rs: Retirement Savings\\n2. 15Rs: Stocks/Business\\n3. 15Rs: Short-Term Savings\\n\\nSecond Batch - Expenses\\n\\n1. 20Rs: Rent/HRA\\n2. 20Rs: General Expenses\\n\\nThird Batch - Others\\n\\n1. 5Rs: Discretionary\\n2. 5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses\\n\\n### Type 2: Have Debt\\n\\nIf you find yourself burdened with loans, a strategic approach is necessary:\\n\\nPriority Batch - Debt Servicing\\n\\n1. 25Rs: EMI\\n2. 10Rs: Principal Repayment\\n\\nFirst Batch - Investment\\n\\n1. 5Rs: Retirement Savings\\n2. 5Rs: Stocks/Business\\n3. 10Rs: Short-Term Savings\\n\\nSecond Batch - Expenses\\n\\n1. 20Rs: Rent/HRA\\n2. 20Rs: General Expenses\\n\\nThird Batch - Others\\n\\n1. 5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\nTwo critical points emerge from these allocations:\\n\\n- Survival Mode: Until your loans are fully serviced, you\'re essentially in survival mode. This phase might be tough, but it\'s essential to secure a healthy financial future.\\n\\n- Future Planning: Without a strategic approach, you might compromise your financial stability in the long run.\\n\\n## Other Tips\\n\\nApart from allocating your salary smartly, consider these practical tips to bolster your financial health:\\n\\n1. Debt Refinancing: Explore options to reduce interest rates on existing loans. If possible, avoid debt leverage to raise wealth or buy consumables.\\n\\n2. Lean Lifestyle: Embrace a frugal lifestyle and look for value buys.\\n\\n3. Family Support: Seek assistance from family to share the financial burden.\\n\\n4. Expense Prevention: Avoid unnecessary expenses that can lead to a chain of additional financial burdens.\\n\\n5. Health and Safety: Maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent unexpected medical expenses.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEveryone aspires to retire peacefully with financial security. Being in survival mode, you cannot retire even in your old age. In a world where loans and notices clutter newspapers, leading a debt-free life simplifies everything. As bachelor techies, understanding your financial type and making strategic decisions today will pave the way for a secure and stress-free tomorrow.\\n\\n> Newspapers would have less pages if nobody defaulted on their loans. Your life would be simple and stress free without debt."},{"id":"/2023/10-take-aways-from-devfest-bangalore","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/10-take-aways-from-devfest-bangalore","source":"@site/blog/2023/10-take-aways-from-devfest-bangalore.md","title":"Unveiling Insights, Devfest 2023 Bangalore Edition Recap","description":"dev fest 2023 banner","date":"2023-12-29T15:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-conference","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-conference"}],"readingTime":3.12,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Unveiling Insights, Devfest 2023 Bangalore Edition Recap","tags":["tech-conference"],"date":"2023-12-29T15:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"One last financial advice blog post for bachelor techies in India","permalink":"/blog/2024/the-last-personal-finance-advice-techies"},"nextItem":{"title":"Navigating the Essentials, My Useless YouTube Gear Investments","permalink":"/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube"}},"content":"![dev fest 2023 banner](../assets/dev-fest-banner.webp)\\n\\nThe grandeur of Devfest 2023 unfolded at the prestigious Lalit Ashok, where Google developers took center stage to orchestrate a symphony of innovation.

I too embarked on this journey, investing in four gadgets with the hope of elevating my content. However, hindsight has brought clarity, revealing that these purchases did not contribute significantly to my YouTube success. In this blog post, I\'ll delve into each gadget and share the lessons learned.\\n\\n## 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality\\nAt first glance, a whiteboard and marker pens seemed like a practical investment to recreate a classroom setting for content demonstrations. However, I soon realized that this setup required a level of confidence and was better suited for academic content. For my YouTube endeavors, originality, presentation, uniqueness, and searchability took precedence over the traditional classroom approach.\\n\\n## 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve\\nDigital pens promised seamless scribbling and emphasis during screen sharing. Unfortunately, the reality included a steep learning curve. The basic digital pen I initially purchased turned out to be of little use without acquiring the specific skills needed. This experience underscored the importance of thoroughly researching and understanding the tools before making a purchase.\\n\\n## 3. Software for Editing: A Windows Update and More\\nVideo editing is an indispensable aspect of content creation, and I invested time in updating my Windows and learning the nuances of video editing. While I achieved some success, the hardware limitations of my PC hindered the production of high-quality, full-HD videos. This realization highlighted the need for a balance between software proficiency and hardware capabilities to meet the standards of modern YouTube content.\\n\\n## 4. Lavalier Microphone: Battling Ambient Noise\\nCapturing pristine audio in a less-than-ideal environment posed a significant challenge. Despite the assistance of a lavalier microphone, the ambient noise from barking dogs and honking drivers persisted, preventing the attainment of studio-quality audio. This experience emphasized the importance of considering the external factors that can impact audio quality and exploring alternative solutions.\\n\\n## Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success\\nIn conclusion, achieving YouTube success requires a blend of skills, awareness, and time commitment\u2014factors that I found myself lacking. While certain gadgets, like a camera stand and a reliable camera phone, proved to be useful, the shift towards shorts and reels emerged as a more practical strategy. Testing content with shorter formats allows creators to gauge audience response without the need for an expensive infrastructure required for full-length videos.\\n\\nAspiring YouTubers should prioritize understanding their niche, refining their content, and gradually investing in tools that align with their evolving needs. Rather than hastily diving into full-length videos, a strategic focus on shorts and reels can provide valuable insights and pave the way for a more sustainable path to YouTube success.\\n\\n> To grow Youtube channel in a lean way, focus of shorts creation and pivot in a inexpensive way"},{"id":"/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation","source":"@site/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation.md","title":"Why I Quit Creating Content on YouTube A Reflection on the Changing Landscape","description":"Introduction:","date":"2023-12-11T15:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"content","permalink":"/blog/tags/content"},{"inline":true,"label":"youtube","permalink":"/blog/tags/youtube"}],"readingTime":2.42,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why I Quit Creating Content on YouTube A Reflection on the Changing Landscape","tags":["content","youtube"],"date":"2023-12-11T15:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Navigating the Essentials, My Useless YouTube Gear Investments","permalink":"/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube"},"nextItem":{"title":"Keeping Updated at Frontend Tech, 4 Strategies Beyond Blogs and Podcasts","permalink":"/blog/2023/4-step-process-to-stay-updated"}},"content":"![](../assets/youtube-app.webp)\\n\\n## Introduction:\\n\\nIn the dynamic world of content creation, platforms like YouTube have played a pivotal role in connecting creators with their audiences. As someone who embarked on a YouTube journey in 2020, I experienced the highs and lows of content creation. However, after three years of dedication, I found myself at a crossroads, leading me to make the tough decision to step away from the platform. In this post, I\'ll delve into the three primary reasons that prompted me to bid farewell to YouTube and explore an alternative path that aligns better with my goals.\\n\\n## Reason 1: Landscape has changed\\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in content creation as people sought new ways to spend their time. The demand for content was high, but by 2023, the landscape had transformed significantly. Educational content creators faced a daunting challenge of standing out amidst the crowd pullers like news, comics, and film-related content. Unfortunately, educational content struggled to capture the audience\'s attention, making it increasingly challenging for solo creators to thrive.\\n\\n## Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted\\nWhile YouTube serves as a vast platform with immense potential, getting content noticed became an uphill battle. The algorithmic changes and sheer volume of content meant that creators had to rely on their existing subscriber base or invest in promotional efforts. For those starting from scratch, breaking through the noise proved to be as challenging as finding a needle in a haystack. The lack of organic promotion made it difficult for new creators without a substantial audience to showcase their work.\\n\\n## Reason 3: Form over content\\nThe evolution of content creation standards brought forth new challenges. The days when a front camera sufficed for creating engaging content are long gone. Today, success demands high-quality cameras, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds, captivating thumbnail graphics, and more. The time-consuming process of adhering to these visual standards often took away from the core focus \u2013 the content itself. This shift towards a more polished presentation, while visually appealing, did not necessarily translate into increased viewership.\\n\\n## Alternative\\nIn light of these challenges, I\'ve decided to retreat from YouTube content creation and refocus my efforts on traditional blogging. Leveraging the power of AI tools, my blogging endeavors have seen a resurgence. The efficiency and effectiveness of these tools have allowed me to rediscover the joy of content creation without the constraints and challenges posed by the ever-evolving landscape of YouTube.\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\n\\nThe decision to step away from YouTube was not made lightly, and it\'s essential for content creators to regularly reassess their chosen platforms. While YouTube remains a giant in the industry, the shifting landscape and challenges faced by solo creators necessitate adaptability. For those seeking a more flexible and personally fulfilling creative outlet, exploring alternative mediums, like traditional blogging with AI enhancements, might prove to be the key to sustained success and satisfaction."},{"id":"/2023/4-step-process-to-stay-updated","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/4-step-process-to-stay-updated","source":"@site/blog/2023/4-step-process-to-stay-updated.md","title":"Keeping Updated at Frontend Tech, 4 Strategies Beyond Blogs and Podcasts","description":"As a dedicated frontend engineer, complacency is not an option.

Dodds\\n- Lin Clark\\n- Nicole Sullivan\\n- Sara Soueidan\\n- Wes Bos\\n\\n\\n## 2. Embrace Conferences and Meetups\\n\\nFrontend conferences and meetups are a treasure trove of insights. While it might not be feasible to watch every presentation on YouTube, you can gain valuable information by skimming through the talk titles. If a particular topic repeatedly surfaces, it\'s a clear indication of its significance. Here are some noteworthy conferences and meetups to keep an eye on:\\n\\nConferences:\\n\\n- Smashing Conference (San Francisco, CA, USA)\\n- React Advanced (London, UK)\\n- VueConf (Multiple locations)\\n- Svelte Summit (Multiple locations)\\n- CSSConf (Multiple locations)\\n- Front-end Developers Conference (Multiple locations)\\n- Full-Stack Web Dev Conference (Multiple locations)\\n- JavaScript Conference (Multiple locations)\\n\\nMeetups:\\n\\n- Front-End Developers Meetup\\n- React Meetup\\n- Vue Meetup\\n- Svelte Meetup\\n- CSS Meetup\\n- Full-Stack Web Dev Meetup\\n- JavaScript Meetup\\n- Web Performance Meetup\\n- Accessibility Meetup\\n\\n\\n## 3. Dive into the Specs\\n\\nFrontend development thrives on open standards, and there are no secrets in this domain. A true professional must dive into the technical specifications. Keep a vigilant eye on the following organizations and their corresponding standards:\\n\\n- For JavaScript, stay updated with TC39.\\n- For HTML and CSS, rely on W3C.\\n- Accessibility standards are set by WCAG.\\n- TypeScript enthusiasts should monitor TypeScript proposals.\\n\\nBecoming adept at deciphering these proposals can qualify you as a tech speaker and provide instant insights for your fellow developers.\\n\\n## 4.

Studying such content, which is tried and tested at scale on millions of users, can lead to innovative breakthroughs in your work. Notable publications, like Thoughtworks\' Radar, delve into a wide array of frontend topics discussed at a CTO level, making them a must-read resource for any serious developer.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nStaying updated in frontend tech is no cakewalk. The methods outlined above may not be the easiest or most convenient, but they are highly effective. There is no easy way, the above said methods are not the easiest like skimming a newsletter or tech blog but I believe you can ascend to the ranks of an expert frontend developer with the above 4 strategies."},{"id":"/2023/4-things-to-ponder-about-fifth-work-anniversary","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/4-things-to-ponder-about-fifth-work-anniversary","source":"@site/blog/2023/4-things-to-ponder-about-fifth-work-anniversary.md","title":"Reflections on Fifth work anniversary, Embracing Challenges and Growth","description":"In the pursuit of professional excellence, one occasionally stumbles upon the state of being set in flow\u2014a harmonious engagement where time seems to slip away effortlessly.

Today, as I mark my fifth work anniversary with my fourth employer, I am overwhelmed with the euphoria of this accomplishment. Throughout my career, I have experienced various moments of significance, and in this blog, I wish to share four events that have shaped my journey.\\n\\n## Embracing Opportunities: The Impact of a Tech Conference\\nAs fate would have it, the most promising opportunities often arise when one is least expecting them. Such was the case when I attended the GIDS conference in 2018. Among the myriad of stalls, Sabre\'s presence caught my attention. Completing intriguing challenges and applying for hiring opportunities, I secured some delightful takeaways from the event. Little did I know that my enthusiasm would lead to a profound connection with the hiring manager, ultimately leading to my employment at Sabre.\\n\\n## Stepping Into Uncharted Territories: The Cultural Shock of Full Stack Development\\nHaving honed my skills in frontend development, joining Sabre introduced me to an entirely new world of full stack development expertise. The experience proved to be both exhilarating and challenging, as I was entrusted with responsibilities beyond the frontend realm. Despite the initial stress, my foundational knowledge in Java enabled me to navigate through unfamiliar territories with confidence and adaptability.\\n\\n## The Challenges of Brownfield Software: A Lesson in Agility\\nIn the dynamic world of software development, greenfield projects often garner excitement, but the complexities of brownfield issues are seldom met with the same enthusiasm. Overcoming these challenges requires not only technical expertise but also strategic proposals to secure the necessary resources. Adapting to the agile development approach, I learned the significance of addressing outdated software libraries and the importance of proactive solutions.\\n\\n## Embracing New Horizons: The Power of Internal Job Postings\\nThroughout my five years, I remained unbound to a single project, exploring different avenues within the organization. This willingness to embrace new opportunities led to a pivotal moment in my career when I received a promotion to lead engineer. Embracing a role within the Enterprise Design Language team, I was immersed in the world of frontend development, which I found to be exhilarating. The experience reinforced the significance of internal job postings, fostering growth and organizational exploration.\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\nAs I reflect upon my journey over the past five years, I am reminded of the power of seizing opportunities, embracing change, and striving for growth. Each experience, whether unexpected or planned, has contributed to my professional development, molding me into a more resilient and adaptable individual. With gratitude for the past and excitement for the future, I eagerly await the challenges and triumphs that await in the next chapter of my career."},{"id":"/2023/4-things-to-know-about-hosur-book-fair","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/4-things-to-know-about-hosur-book-fair","source":"@site/blog/2023/4-things-to-know-about-hosur-book-fair.md","title":"4 things you need to know about The Enthralling Annual Book Fair in Hosur, A Haven for Literature Enthusiasts","description":"\\"Balaji at Hosur Book Festival\\"","date":"2023-07-23T15:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":2.26,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"4 things you need to know about The Enthralling Annual Book Fair in Hosur, A Haven for Literature Enthusiasts","tags":["books"],"date":"2023-07-23T15:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reflections on Fifth work anniversary, Embracing Challenges and Growth","permalink":"/blog/2023/4-things-to-ponder-about-fifth-work-anniversary"},"nextItem":{"title":"4 Pillars of Financial Success for Individuals in India","permalink":"/blog/2023/4-pillars-of-financial-success"}},"content":"![\\"Balaji at Hosur Book Festival\\"](../assets/at-hosur-book-festival.webp)\\n\\nAs an ardent book enthusiast residing in an emerging city, I have often faced the challenge of finding a well-stocked bookstore or literary hub in the vicinity. However, to invigorate our minds and hearts, the residents of Hosur organize an annual book fair that has become a highly anticipated event on our cultural calendar. Having attended this remarkable fair since 2017, I present here four essential aspects that encapsulate its significance.\\n\\n## A Celebration of Tamil Literature\\n\\nHappening in the heart of Tamil Nadu, the Hosur Book Fair predominantly showcases an impressive collection of books within the realm of Tamil literature. From timeless classics such as Thirukural to masterpieces like Ponniyan Selvan, the fair offers an array of literary treasures that cater to the diverse tastes of the Tamil-speaking populace. A dedicated book store with books related to Periyar, how about that.\\n\\n## Diverse Religious Book Stalls\\n\\nA distinctive feature of the book fair is the presence of stalls dedicated to various religious themes and spiritual pursuits. Visitors can explore bookshelves teeming with Islamic texts, works by Isha Foundation, and other publications centered around religious ideologies. Importantly, these stalls respect the individual choices of visitors, making the experience inclusive and welcoming.\\n\\n## Unearthing Literary Gems: The Used Book Stalls\\n\\nA true delight for bibliophiles, the fair boasts a fascinating array of used book stalls akin to an adventurous treasure hunt. Many of these stalls offer books previously owned by readers or libraries outside India. The books are sold either by weight or individually at a nominal price of Rs 100 per piece, providing exceptional value for those seeking hidden literary treasures.\\n\\n## The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors\\n\\nIn a world rife with counterfeit copies, the book fair stands out as a reliable platform where customers can acquire authentic books directly from esteemed distributors, publishers, and reputable book houses. Unlike some online platforms that occasionally deal in pirated editions, the fair assures visitors of genuine and legally sourced literature. While the prices might marginally exceed those found on certain online retailers, patrons are more than willing to invest in the assurance of authenticity.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe annual Hosur Book Fair has evolved into a remarkable celebration of literature and culture, enchanting the bookworms of the city and beyond. With its emphasis on Tamil literature, diverse religious offerings, captivating used book stalls, and a commitment to genuine publications, this literary extravaganza has etched a special place in the hearts of the attendees. As a devoted visitor, I eagerly look forward to each edition of the fair, for it not only rejuvenates the mind but also fosters a profound appreciation for the world of written words."},{"id":"/2023/4-pillars-of-financial-success","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/4-pillars-of-financial-success","source":"@site/blog/2023/4-pillars-of-financial-success.md","title":"4 Pillars of Financial Success for Individuals in India","description":"In the pursuit of financial success, individuals often dedicate a significant amount of time to consuming financial news, financial literature, minimalist techniques or simply ask their friends for ideas.

In this article, we will focus on four essential pillars of financial success for individuals with an Indian background. By following these principles, individuals can strive towards a more secure and prosperous financial future.\\n\\nBy focusing on steady income growth, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and holding long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and build a solid foundation for the future.\\n\\n## Steady growing income\\n\\nEstablishing a steady growing income is a fundamental principle for individuals in India who aspire to achieve financial success. In a country where many middle-class individuals experience limited job growth and security, relying on a single source of income can be precarious. Personally they have to rack up atleast one year worth of expenses in a liquid fund or fixed deposit which I categorize as lazy funds.\\n\\nIts surprising to see senior advocates, doctors, businessmen making handsome income in their late 80s but a retired engineer making nothing other than his pension if any. \\n\\n> Tip #1: Choosing a retirement proof career is key in financial planning.\\n\\nIf you are already mid way through career, start and grow a promising business because business owner cannot be fired or forced to retire by labour laws.\\n\\n## Declining or reduced liabilities\\n\\nTraditionally, individuals in India would secure employment within their local communities and often live with extended family or in joint households. Consequently, recurring expenses such as rent, electricity, and locking up money in the form of advances or security deposits were relatively unheard of. However, the modern lifestyle has led to an alarming increase in imprudent accumulation of liabilities. Even before securing employment, individuals often find themselves burdened with education loans, followed by payday loans soon after receiving their first salary. While it is not fair to blame individuals entirely, the expenses associated with metropolitan living necessitate managing multiple financial responsibilities with a limited income, leaving minimal room for savings in their 40s.\\n\\nMaintaining strong family connections, prioritizing children\'s needs, and preserving cultural traditions can quickly deplete financial resources, making one\'s 30s more challenging than anticipated. Ultimately, achieving financial success requires generating income several times greater than one\'s liabilities. If it proves difficult to substantially increase income, it is imperative to focus on reducing costs and minimizing liabilities. Many successful individuals have chosen to retain modest lifestyles, refraining from upgrading furniture, driving smaller vehicles, and using the same vehicle for extended periods.\\n\\n> Tip #2: Avoid the shiny, fad and impractical expenses. Think long term before you commit for something.\\n\\n## Not incurring major losses\\n\\nIt is an undeniable fact that the path to wealth creation has always been filled with risks and uncertainties. A notable story from the book \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" recounts an individual who lost their investments due to misguided advice when purchasing gold, resulting in poor decision-making. Today, individuals continue to face similar challenges, often influenced by biased recommendations from stockbrokers, mis-selling insurance agents, and other vested interests. Countless individuals have taken leaps of faith only to discover that their ventures led to significant financial losses, whether through failed businesses or ill-informed investment decisions. Such losses can have long-term consequences on one\'s financial stability and progress.\\n\\n> Tip #3: In new ventures, Diversify even if the returns are less because losing capital means losing the game of financial success.\\n\\n## Create & Holding long term growth assets \\n\\nAnecdotally, we often encounter stories of individuals who achieved substantial wealth by merely leading ordinary lives and retaining inherited ancestral properties. While inheriting wealth is undoubtedly advantageous, those without such fortune must exchange their money for the creation, growth, and retention of assets.\\n\\nIt is essential to recognize that assets need not be limited to gold, stocks, or land. Owning a thriving tea stall in a strategic location that was once neglected but is now a prime spot exemplifies a valuable asset. Many successful family businesses in India trace their roots back to the entrepreneurial efforts of grandparents who fearlessly embarked on ventures that yielded fruitful returns.\\n\\nRather than advocating for excessively frugal lifestyles or sacrificing vacations to save money, it is more advantageous to focus on creating assets that can generate significant returns over the long term.\\n\\n> Tip #4: Put time in creating assets instead of trying to save rupees in short term\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe road to financial success is not easy especially when you have a family which includes dependents, a society who pushes new fads like spending 2 lakhs on child first birthday, a govt which introduces taxes on whatever you do and use, a job where growth is like a slow moving train, etc. But good use of money can make you comfortable financially. Its okay to be comfortable than be miserable in terms of money.\\n\\nAchieving financial success in India requires a combination of discipline, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective. By prioritizing a steady growing income, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and focusing on long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and increase their chances of achieving their financial goals."},{"id":"/2023/4-things-novice-developers-ignore","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/4-things-novice-developers-ignore","source":"@site/blog/2023/4-things-novice-developers-ignore.md","title":"4 things novice developers ignore and what can be done about it","description":"Self-taught individuals, boot camp graduates, mentored professionals, accomplished interns, and dedicated experts are some of the remarkable talents that have joined our workforce.

While their technical skills are exceptional, it\'s important to recognize that becoming the best programmer at work entails more than just technical expertise. To make a comprehensive and valuable contribution to our organization, it is crucial to cultivate the following skills:\\n\\n## Plan\\n\\n In the corporate world, even individuals who have been laid off often had a significant workload and a backlog of tasks. This highlights the substantial volume of work within most teams. As new joiners, it is essential to actively and purposefully select assignments that challenge your abilities and contribute to unblocking the team\'s progress. Additionally, identifying tasks that align with your strengths can further enhance your impact.\\n\\n > Let your peers know your strength through your work that you do.\\n\\n## Review\\n\\n Being a coder goes beyond the act of pushing code to a repository. It involves reviewing, providing feedback, and improving upon the work done by the team. Many codebases contain sections that have remained untouched for years. By reviewing such code, new joiners can engage in knowledge sharing and take the initiative to improve areas that may be unfamiliar to others.\\n \\n > Being proficient in reading and understanding others\' code can accelerate your career growth.\\n\\n## Collaborate\\n\\n The contributions of individual developers often go unnoticed in most teams. Exceptional communication skills are highly valued in such environments. Developers who can effectively communicate, lead engaging meetings, facilitate discussions, and manage virtual interactions are highly sought-after. Remember that meetings are an integral part of corporate life at various levels. Adhering to basic meeting etiquette, actively contributing valuable insights, and making meetings enjoyable can make a significant impact.\\n\\n > Keeping mum and over talking on the job are dangerous. \\n\\n## Professional Behavior\\n\\nIt is common for young engineers to form friendships within their intern groups, typically with individuals of similar experience levels. However, as young joiners in a professional setting, different expectations apply. Actively engaging with senior engineers and learning from their expertise through close collaboration is essential. Displaying good manners, maintaining a professional demeanor, and exhibiting positive attitudes contribute to professional growth and attract attention within the industry. Simple gestures like a firm handshake, a warm smile, and a proactive attitude establish credibility, respect, and foster positive relationships.\\n\\n> Youre being watched by your peers, behave diligently even when out of office.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nA well-rounded professional understands the needs of the team and actively seeks opportunities to contribute rather than being solely focused on individual goals. By honing these skills, you will not only excel in your role but also establish yourself as a valuable asset within our organization."},{"id":"/2023/experience-going-through-right-sizing-season","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/experience-going-through-right-sizing-season","source":"@site/blog/2023/experience-going-through-right-sizing-season.md","title":"Right-Sizing, Five Things You Need to Know","description":"Here is a short memoir about the right sizing function happening at all major organizations in 2023.","date":"2023-05-24T15:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"work","permalink":"/blog/tags/work"}],"readingTime":7.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Right-Sizing, Five Things You Need to Know","tags":["work"],"date":"2023-05-24T15:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"4 things novice developers ignore and what can be done about it","permalink":"/blog/2023/4-things-novice-developers-ignore"},"nextItem":{"title":"How I created functional custom google domains email address \\"balaji@dhbalaji.dev\\"","permalink":"/blog/custom-email-address"}},"content":"Here is a short memoir about the right sizing function happening at all major organizations in 2023.\\n\\n![](../assets/no-vaccancies.webp)\\n\\n## Businesses Cycles are Real\\n\\nWarren Buffett is a renowned investor who has made a fortune by investing in undervalued companies. He is also known for\\nhis wit and humor. One of his most famous quotes is:\\n\\n> \\"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who\'s been swimming naked.\\"\\n\\nThis quote, which was originally intended for investors, is also applicable to corporate employees. Not long ago, we\\nexperienced a period of rapid hiring, with employees receiving multiple offers and corporations going on a hiring spree.\\nDuring this time, employees were able to negotiate favorable terms, such as high salaries, compensation packages, and\\npositions. However, economic cycles are real, and eventually, companies become overstaffed and their financial results\\nsuffer. As a result, companies begin to lay off employees.\\n\\nThe quote \\"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who\'s been swimming naked\\" is a reminder that economic conditions\\ncan change quickly, and that companies need to be prepared for downturns. When the economy is strong, it is easy to get\\ncaught up in the excitement and make decisions that are not sustainable in the long run. However, when the economy\\nturns, companies that have been overextended will be the ones that suffer the most. The employees at these companies\\nwill suffer the most.\\n\\n> 2023 is the year of right-sizing companies, and it is having a significant impact on Indians working in multinational\\n> corporations.\\n\\nThe media and press have been reporting on layoffs, and this has created a sense of anxiety and uncertainty among\\nemployees. When a common person meets a techie, they often inquire about their job security. The abbreviation \\"CFBR\\" is\\nalso becoming increasingly common on LinkedIn. This stands for \\"Commenting For Better Reach,\\" and it refers to the\\npractice of commenting on posts from people who are looking for work.\\n\\nThere are a number of factors that are contributing to the right-sizing of companies. These include the global economic\\nslowdown, the rise of automation, and the increasing competition from emerging markets. As a result of these factors,\\nmany companies are finding it necessary to reduce their workforces.\\n\\nThe right-sizing of companies is having a significant impact on Indians working in multinational corporations. Many\\nemployees have been laid off, and those who remain are facing increased pressure to perform. The job market is also\\nbecoming more competitive, as more and more people are looking for work.\\n\\n## Observations\\n\\nHere are your observations about right sizing and how to mitigate risk, in a more professional tone:\\n\\n### There is no good news\\n\\nRight-sizing, or downsizing is the process of reducing the size of a company\'s workforce. This can be done through\\nlayoffs, attrition, or a combination of the two. Right-sizing can be a difficult decision for companies, but it is often\\nnecessary in order to remain competitive.\\n\\nThere is no good news for employees who are affected by right-sizing. The job market is already competitive, and\\nright-sizing can make it even more difficult to find a new job. In addition, right-sizing can have a negative impact on\\nthe morale and productivity of the employees who still remain with the organizations.\\n\\nMost companies are not actively hiring during this economic downturn.\\n\\n### The Education material may not help you greatly\\n\\nRight-sizing can lead to an increase in demand for education and training. Employees who are laid off may need to\\nupskill or re-skill in order to find new jobs. However, the education sector may not be able to keep up with the dynamic\\nmarket nature.\\n\\nIn addition, employers may be reluctant to hire employees who have only recently completed education or training. They\\nmay prefer to hire employees who have deeper experience in the field.\\n\\n### Everything looks scary, Generative AI & Self Doubt\\n\\nRight-sizing can be a very stressful experience for employees. It can lead to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and\\nfear. In addition, employees may start to doubt their own abilities. They may worry that they will not be able to find a\\nnew job, or that they will not be able to find a job that is as good as their old one.\\n\\nGenerative AI and other new technologies can also add to the stress of right-sizing. These technologies can make it\\neasier for companies to replace employees with machines. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and obsolescence.\\n\\n### Multiple rounds of layoff disturb morale at work\\n\\nRight-sizing can have a negative impact on morale at work. Employees who are laid off may feel betrayed and resentful.\\nIn addition, employees who remain may be worried about their own job security. This can lead to a decrease in\\nproductivity and an increase in turnover. Both physical and mental health will suffer.\\n\\n### Hope for the best and prepare for the worst\\n\\nThere is no surefire way to avoid being laid off. However, there are some things that employees can do to increase their\\nchances of surviving right-sizing.\\n\\n- Join a profitable company. Employees are more likely to be laid off from companies that are struggling financially.\\n  Therefore, it is important to join a company that is profitable and has a good reputation.\\n\\n- Ensure that your work has a business value. Employees who do work that is essential to the company\'s operations are\\n  less likely to be laid off. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your work is valuable to the company.\\n\\n- Become a valuable asset to the company. Employees who are valuable assets to the company are less likely to be laid\\n  off. This means being able to do more than one thing, being able to work independently, and being able to think\\n  outside the box.\\n\\n- Be positive and proactive. Employees who are positive and proactive are more likely to be seen as valuable assets to\\n  the company. They are also more likely to be able to find new jobs if they are laid off.\\n\\n- Have a financial cushion. Employees who have a financial cushion are less likely to be stressed out if they are laid\\n  off. This means having enough money saved up to cover your expenses for at least six months.\\n\\n- Embrace rightsizing as part of career and plan accordingly. Avoid spending on lifestyle inflation like a fancy car,\\n  flat, etc. Instead, spend time on marketing yourself like personal website, network, etc. Employees have a shelf life\\n  like any other commodity.\\n\\n## Other myths\\n\\nSure, here are some myths related to right sizing in tech companies, along with some clarifications:\\n\\n**Myth 1**: Young and low-level engineers are exempted during right sizing.\\n\\n**Fact**: Everyone is examined through a different lens, regardless of experience level or position. In some cases,\\nyoung\\nand low-level engineers may be more likely to be laid off, as they may be seen as less essential to the company\'s\\noperations. However, this is not always the case, and there are many factors that companies consider when making layoff\\ndecisions. No department is safe during right sizing including human resources and accounting.\\n\\n**Myth 2**: Seniors and managerial staff are most hit during right sizing.\\n\\n**Fact**: While managerial staff layoffs and top level exits are widely discussed. In fact, in some cases, companies may\\nchoose to retain managerial staff in order to maintain continuity and leadership during a time of change.\\n\\n**Myth 3**: Contractors will be let go first.\\n\\n**Fact**: Contractors will be impacted, but they are not always let go first during right sizing. In some cases,\\ncompanies may choose to retain\\ncontractors in order to finish the ongoing projects. Once the work is done, their contracts may not be extended.\\n\\n**Myth 4**: Companies cut all the extra costs before considering right sizing employees.\\n\\n**Fact**: While companies may try to cut costs in other areas before laying off employees, this is not always possible.\\nThe fancy pantry, expensive office buildings will still operate with some modifications.\\nIn\\nsome cases, the only way for a company to remain profitable is to lay off employees.\\n\\n**Myth 5**: Jobs cut in high-cost centers are moved to low-cost centers.\\n\\n**Fact**: This is not necessarily true. While companies may sometimes move jobs to lower-cost centers, this is not\\nalways\\npossible or feasible. In some cases, the only way for a company to remain profitable is to lay off employees in all\\nlocations.\\n\\nIt is important to note that these are just some of the myths related to right sizing in tech companies. The specific\\nfactors that companies consider when making layoff decisions will vary from company to company.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nTo sum up, right-sizing can be a very stressful experience for employees. It can feel like a runtime exception at work,\\nwhere everything is suddenly thrown into chaos. However, by following the tips above, employees can increase their\\nchances of surviving right-sizing and finding a new job.\\n\\nOnly during right sizing activities we realize the value of money and time."},{"id":"/custom-email-address","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/custom-email-address","source":"@site/blog/2023/how-I-created-functional-custom-email-address.md","title":"How I created functional custom google domains email address \\"balaji@dhbalaji.dev\\"","description":"Here is the story behind functional custom email address balaji@dhbalaji.dev","date":"2023-05-14T18:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"email","permalink":"/blog/tags/email"}],"readingTime":1.29,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How I created functional custom google domains email address \\"balaji@dhbalaji.dev\\"","tags":["email"],"date":"2023-05-14T18:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"],"slug":"/custom-email-address"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Right-Sizing, Five Things You Need to Know","permalink":"/blog/2023/experience-going-through-right-sizing-season"},"nextItem":{"title":"Videos are now under a minute but resumes are still lengthy, hello infographic resumes","permalink":"/blog/infographic-resume"}},"content":"Here is the story behind functional custom email address `balaji@dhbalaji.dev`\\n\\n![](../assets//gmail-with-alias-dropdown.webp)\\n\\n## Why custom email domains\\n\\nThe custom email addresses look more professional on the resume or back of the truck, hope you got my point.

Hey Covid, you added bunch of excuses to the list. I do not use Groww app however I decided to attend this meeting to hear the financial jargon. This meeting was first of its kind, a meeting about finances is not something that happens often in upcoming cities.\\n\\n## Venue and arrangements\\n\\nThe venue was in district headquarters or Taluk. The hotel was in a decent location, well-connected to all means of transport. Event had adequate branding arrangements. Not too flashy or the absence of it.\\n\\nThere was a small stage suitable for one speaker to stand and present his contents to a room of 50 to 75 people.\\n\\n![](../assets/groww-stage.webp)\\n\\nI reached the venue first, and it was an empty room but towards the end, the hall was full.\\n\\n## Audience\\n\\nFree tickets were to be booked on eventbrite platform in advance. \\n\\nThe room had people who where in their teens until retirement. I think the Groww team estimated the audience demographic details by their experience. They had a certified financial planner to give a financial talk for close to 1.5 hours.\\n\\n## Speaker\\n\\nHis name is Karthik, and he is a CFA. Because that\'s all we know about him. There was hardly any speaker introduction or hype or welcome address. \\n\\nThe speaker also did not do PR for Groww. The speaker maintained a neutral view without being sales focused.\\n\\n## Key takeaways\\n\\nThe general purpose of a speech presented by the CFP would essentially be around having a financial plan in place, identifying goals and arranging corpus for goals. The speaker delivered a well crafted speech backed by research and data.\\n\\nLet me present the unique points apart from stock selection theory, retirement planning, investment choices which were spoken on the stage.\\n\\n### Comparing similar stocks before buying\\n\\nLet us assume you are an informed investor. You would select a sector, then industry, and then the stock. But have you compared the stock pick with the peers thoroughly? I do not do that because I know only about company X and not its peers. \\n\\nThe simplest way to compare would be to use screener website peers table or make your own table with key KPI and access the peers closely. We might pick a better stock in this approach.\\n\\n> There are 18 sectors listed on NSE.\\n\\n### Evergreen funds and SIP Millionaires\\n\\n> The average SIP tenure is about 3 years.\\n\\nWe have seen the fancy Groww SIP calculator throwing 8 figures when you input a decent SIP number and 15 years of tenure but how many really get to realize the numbers? Not many of us, because markets are volatile, scary and nerve wrecking when the corpus gets bigger. \\n\\n> In short term the market generates losses but in a period of 10+ years the chances of market investment making losses is very low. \\n\\nAn average investor tends to take the money out of MF or stop the SIP process. This is preventing people from becoming crorepati. \\n\\nThe assumption is that you invest your money into flexi cap fund or some evergreen funds which are professionally managed. Mutual funds can be compared to market performance. If the MF is consistently underperformed for multiple years in a row in spite of markets going upwards, then you may have to switch the MF.\\n\\n> High P/E stocks essentially means that in case of crash, it would take longer time to recover from the crash.\\n\\n### Approaching investments\\n\\nThe speaker did not say mutual fund sahi hai at all. The speaker was an advocate of tagging an investment to a goal. Tagging investment to a goal relieves the investor from emotional conundrums like should I take my money out or should I worry about the crash, etc.\\n\\nLet us say you are saving for child college, then the ripe time to think of withdrawing money would be 3 years before college. Withdrawal can be done in SWP.\\n\\n> As long as the financial goal is met, the investment vehicle hardly matters. \\n\\nInvestment options should be evaluated in the context of risk and return.\\n\\n### Trends\\n\\nEveryone like to be a part of a trend which is bullish, has a long run raking profits for its share holders.\\n\\nHere are few things we need to be aware of\\n\\n- Markets follow cycles like accumulation phase, distribution phase, bull phase, bear phase, etc\\n- Trends arise out of new market opportunities or opportunities in particular sector\\n- Be good at\\n  - Identifying trends\\n  - Taking calculated risk\\n  - Reading trend lines\\n  - Trend reversal\\n- If you can spot trends ahead of one quarter, then you are going to make profit or book profits.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n> Money decisions should be logical and not emotional.\\n\\nAn evening well spent with good amount of information and surprise goodies which was a T-Shirt.\\n\\nYou can have a good financial future if you have a \\n\\n- Steady income\\n- Wont make big losses\\n- Save consistently \\n- Plan ahead\\n- Won\'t make emotional spends.\\n\\n> Save first, spend next."},{"id":"/nvm-use-nvm","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/nvm-use-nvm","source":"@site/blog/2023/use-nvm-use.md","title":"Use nvm use while switching codebases","description":"Disclaimer: Works only on mac OS & Linux","date":"2023-04-04T15:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-solved-it","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-solved-it"}],"readingTime":0.66,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Use nvm use while switching codebases","tags":["tech-solved-it"],"date":"2023-04-04T15:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"],"slug":"/nvm-use-nvm"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Groww App users meeting in Krishnagiri","permalink":"/blog/groww-app-user-meetings"},"nextItem":{"title":"Chatgpt vs Alexa at work, 5 use cases compared","permalink":"/blog/chatgpt-vs-alexa"}},"content":"> Disclaimer: Works only on mac OS & Linux\\n\\nWhen you work with modern and legacy codebases, we have to switch the node versions that fits the project.\\n\\nMost developers are familiar with `nvm` aka Node version manager.\\n\\nWhile we switch to a codebase which uses a different codebase, use `nvm use` command.

Understanding our biases and using them to our advantage is the motive behind taking up the video course on cognitive biases.\\n\\n## Confirmation bias\\n\\nLets say you met with an accident due to negligent driving at some point in life and you survived. For the rest of your life, you will be quick to spot negligent drivers and even predict when they would fall from the bike. Two things happened to you in this situation\\n\\n1. Something happened to you which affected you emotionally\\n2. Based on the past event, your mind is taking decisions\\n\\nThats the high level overview of confirmation bias. Lets look the advantages and disadvantages of confirmation bias.\\n\\n** Advantages ** \\n\\nYou can quickly infer that based on situation that the same set of actions give same results. You are sure of it and even go about spreading the word about your observation.\\n\\nIn professions like law, you can quickly get into the shoes of your client and offer legal services with confidence.\\n\\n** Disadvantages **\\n\\nYou do not validate your data again. For instance, technogical advances would have offered better bikes which can be driven at higher speeds but you would be still believing that high speeds will only result in accidents.\\n\\nFalsification is an important step to break confirmation bias. Instead of using the language that confirms the biased person, ask them why they are unsatisfied with the situation. While falsifying their data, they get better and come over their bias.\\n\\n** Traits **\\n\\nThe person with confirmation bias exhibits the below behaviours\\n\\n- Operate like an `echo chamber`. Shows preference over the data points or stimuli\\n- Does not take the risk of falsyfying his data or habits\\n- Exhibits `drawer effect` where he shows only the hits and hides the misses\\n- Practice selective recall of events/data\\n- Most of the decisions are memory based\\n- Design their methodology to make their thoughts to suceed. It could be a algorithm thats designed to maneur their thoughts and operate in that direction only.\\n- Occassionally make illusionary associations.\\n\\n** Work around **\\n\\nFor people with conformation bias, they need to pair up with `skeptics` as they need good evidence.\\n\\n## Pareidolia\\n\\nPareidolia is about how we associate random shapes to something that we already familiar with. For example, we can identify familiar faces even in a packed crowd of people.\\n\\nHumans have large brains, there is a center which is dedicated to recognizing faces and patterns.\\n\\n** Advantages **\\n\\nBy observing patterns we can quickly arrive at a conclusion. Pareidolia makes dealing with large set of unpredictable stimuli easier. If something has sharp teeth and agressive, its a dangerous predator. If something has eyes to the side, its a prey.\\n\\nAllows us to take snap decisions based on familiarity with the shape or pattern\\n\\n** Disadvantages **\\n\\nRelying on familiarity with patterns over organized knowledge or schemas is a risky behaviour.\\n\\nWhen we lack social connect with humans which is our first choice, we tend to look for social connect with pets and anything that can be recognized as a face. For instance, a car with 2 lights and a grill looks like a human face and people tend to give it a human name or pet name.\\n\\n** Work around ** \\n\\nJust like confirmation bias is about data, pareidolia is about patterns and affinity towards shapes. We need to be aware of it."},{"id":"/External-dvd-drive-wont-show-win10","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/External-dvd-drive-wont-show-win10","source":"@site/blog/External-dvd-drive-wont-show-win10.md","title":"How to fix, external dvd drive not working on windows 10","description":"Though you may argue that the end of the DVD era has already begun, I had run into scenarios where CD/DVD is still a suitable storage device given the read-only nature of the device.

The process to troubleshoot the strange behavior is as follows\\n\\n1. Observe if the LG/DVD writer powers on. If yes, press the button to eject the tray. This step worked\\n\\n2. The second step was to look at my computer to see if any new icon has shown up, but nothing showed up. So fire up the device manager and look for dvd devices\\n\\n3. Right-click on the USB DVD drive and uninstall the driver. Then reinstall the driver. Even after this step, the icon would not show up.\\n\\n4. Right-click and goto properties and goto volumes. Click on the populate button. A new name should have been created for this device and the corresponding icon would show up on my computer.\\n\\n5. Once the icon is available, double-clicking should eject the tray. It works as expected.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThanks to the LG website for clarifying that no special drivers are required for the DVD RW device since they are plug-and-play only. That means they would work on any Operating system ideally. Later I found windows 10 just put in an extra step that prevented me from using the drive or rather thinking it was dead.\\n\\n> Pinch of common sense, curiousity and passion can open the doors for you in tech."},{"id":"/mocking-dates-in-jest","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mocking-dates-in-jest","source":"@site/blog/mocking-dates-in-jest.md","title":"Why & how to mock date methods in JEST unit tests","description":"What are the Date methods?","date":"2022-10-23T23:22:36.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":1.56,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why & how to mock date methods in JEST unit tests","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2022-10-23T23:22:36.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to fix, external dvd drive not working on windows 10","permalink":"/blog/External-dvd-drive-wont-show-win10"},"nextItem":{"title":"Turborepo npm workspaces vite react module resolution error resolved","permalink":"/blog/turborepo-vite-react-module-not-found-issue-resolution"}},"content":"## What are the `Date` methods?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have worked with a bunch of web apps and all of them have date-related code in common. The Date utils are written in plain Javascript using the `Date` constructor. \\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nvar date = new Date()\\r\\n\\r\\n// Sample date methods\\r\\ndate.getMonth()\\r\\ndate.getFullYear()\\r\\ndate.getDate()\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI have also worked on issues where the test suite would pass correctly on the day the tests were authored but they would fail on the other day or in the server. This is because the dates are getting dynamically generated in the test but the matcher value is static.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why is testing Dates tricky?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou cannot assert a dynamically generated date. For instance, if your date until returns a new date by applying some logic. You cannot put a test that looks like this.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// WRONG code, don\'t use without mocking date.getDate\\r\\n\\r\\nexpect(add2DaysToCurrentDate()).toBe(\\"Some hard coded date\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to use a hardcoded date, you should be able to control the output of the `add2DaysToCurrentDate` method.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to make dynamic date logic predictable?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short answer is `JEST mocks`. Whenever we want to add 2 days to the current date, we need to ensure the `date.getDate()` method returns the same value, then we can write a test to assert the returned value.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nit(\\"should return new Date which is two days ahead of today\\", function() {\\r\\n  jest.spyOn(Date, \\"getDate\\").mockImplementation(() => 14) // Mocks the getDate method until this test block\\r\\n  expect(add2DaysToCurrentDate()).toBe(\\"Some hard coded date\\")\\r\\n})\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Downsides to this approach\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I mentioned in the comment, till the end of the test block, we cannot use `date.getDate()` as if it\'s a real function. The mock will replace the actual function call in the test block. This might hinder your assertion logic. We need to plan accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### References\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29719631/how-do-i-set-a-mock-date-in-jest"},{"id":"/turborepo-vite-react-module-not-found-issue-resolution","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/turborepo-vite-react-module-not-found-issue-resolution","source":"@site/blog/turborepo-vite-react-module-not-found-issue-resolution.md","title":"Turborepo npm workspaces vite react module resolution error resolved","description":"From the title it sounds like a lot of cool technologies working side by side isn\'t it.

Let me list them once again\\r\\n\\r\\n- Turborepo - managing monorepo\\r\\n- NPM - package manager\\r\\n- NPM workspaces - also provided by npm, assists in monorepo\\r\\n- vite - frontend tooling, rollup wrapper\\r\\n- vite react - template for vite\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use case scenario\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a cool `monorepo` on github which holds all my sample projects, experimental works and code sample which I play around with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monorepo is build with npm workspaces & turborepo. I must admit that I hardly use any turbo repo features yet. Its mostly npm workspaces and npm commands at scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nI encountered vite for frontend tooling and wanted to give it a try. Without a second thought, I created a directory called `tooling` and started working with `vite`.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Glitches and resolutions\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The first glitch was the node version requirement of `vite`. I opened a new terminal and used nvm to set the node version to latest. Thats expected bug while working with latest nodeJS tools.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The `vite` module was installed locally within the workspace. However the same `vite` module was referenced in `vite.config.js`. `npm` would try to resolve `vite` by checking in the global `node_modules` but it would not be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand why `npm` installed `vite` locally instead of global `node_modules` was easy. `vite` was used in `npm scripts` and if `vite` were to be installed globally then the `npm scripts` would fail mercilessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n```json\\r\\n\\"scripts\\": {\\r\\n    \\"dev\\": \\"vite\\",\\r\\n    \\"build\\": \\"vite build\\",\\r\\n    \\"preview\\": \\"vite preview\\"\\r\\n  },\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the same module being used in JS modules was not expected by `npm`, so we need to instruct `npm` to install `vite` in both local and global `node_modules`.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Resolution\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this step I found 2 ways to solve the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The first way is something hinted by turborepo scaffold itself. I had to add `vite` as dev dependency at the root of the monorepo. This would ensure that `vite` is installed into the global `node_modules`.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The second way is to use an alias for `vite` within the workspace. You can do this with the below command\\r\\n\\r\\n`npm i my-vite@npm:vite -P`\\r\\n\\r\\nThis command would ensure that the package `vite` is alias as `my-vite`. While checking the global `node_modules` folder, I noticed a folder with the name `my-vite`.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./assets/my-vite.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flipside is that, I need to reference the `vite` package as `my-vite` within the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nimport { defineConfig } from \\"my-vite\\";\\r\\n```"},{"id":"/Installing-ubuntu-desktop-explained-in-10-steps","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Installing-ubuntu-desktop-explained-in-10-steps","source":"@site/blog/Installing-ubuntu-desktop-explained-in-10-steps.md","title":"Installing Ubuntu Desktop explained in 10 steps","description":"Ubuntu desktop download","date":"2022-09-13T19:15:19.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux"}],"readingTime":1.09,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Installing Ubuntu Desktop explained in 10 steps","tags":["linux"],"date":"2022-09-13T19:15:19.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Turborepo npm workspaces vite react module resolution error resolved","permalink":"/blog/turborepo-vite-react-module-not-found-issue-resolution"},"nextItem":{"title":"5 tips to Organize meetings at scale with MS teams at your organization","permalink":"/blog/organizing-larger-meetings-on-teams"}},"content":"![Ubuntu desktop download](./assets/ubuntu-download.webp)\\n\\nInstalling Ubuntu Desktop is a job with no frills but you do not install Ubuntu quite often so it\'s natural to forget a few things so here are the 10 steps which I followed while installing Ubuntu desktop in 2022.\\n\\n1.

We have **strategic touch points** through which we keep in touch with the developers who consume our library. They are \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Newsletters through email\\r\\n2. Broadcast on monitors across the office or even the display on the coffee machine\\r\\n3. MS teams meetings\\r\\n    1. Training sessions through MS teams meetings\\r\\n    2. Internal talks for niche audiences again through MS teams meetings\\r\\n    3. Open office hours for actual developers through MS teams meetings\\r\\n    4. Highlighting the EDL and its significance to the managers and above through MS teams meetings\\r\\n    5. Syncing up the designers about the component variants and their usage\\r\\n    6. Consulting with product teams when they need professional support\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least 60% of our activities outside of the code editor rely on the MS teams. To be successful at MS teams meetings, here are a few tips which I have learned from experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the tips\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Schedule the meeting at an accessible & convenient time.\\r\\n2. Give presenter access to a select few on MS teams, the rest are the audience.\\r\\n3. Use the apps & tools in MS teams to boost interactivity and empower the introverted audience.\\r\\n4. Use a raised hand to unmute the audience to avoid distractions during meetings.\\r\\n5. Have a meeting plan in detail. This includes \\r\\n    1. Pre-meeting plan\\r\\n    2. Actual meeting plan\\r\\n    3. Post-meeting follow-up plan\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tip #1: Schedule the meeting at an accessible & convenient time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are leading with power, then you need not worry about the timing of the meeting. A Friday evening call would work fine but as a lead engineer on a little-known team, your options are limited. Here are things that I look for before scheduling a meeting across the org.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Find out the other events falling on the same day at the organization level and avoid overlapping times or avoid the day. It could be \\r\\n    1. Town halls for verticals\\r\\n    2. HR events\\r\\n    3. Employee engagements\\r\\n    4. Standup meetings\\r\\n    5. Coffee time and lunch breaks\\r\\n2. Find out if there is a holiday either on the before day or on the next day. People would be in a hurry to get work done from the previous day or leave for the holiday the following day.\\r\\n3. Find out if the presenters or organizing committee members are available for the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the hurdles are identified and inventory is prepared. We have to intimate the team which sends mass emails to the audience.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tip #2: Give presenter access to a select few and the rest are audience on MS teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been in multiple meetings where the audience join the meeting with their mic and camera turned on. What a condescending distraction that could be. The cure to this problem is to know your controls on MS teams. I am sure, not everyone in the larger crowd shall be presenters or even willing to do so. Here is what we need to do\\r\\n\\r\\n1. While you schedule meetings, go to meeting options and preselect the presenters to organizers. The rest of them are audience by default.\\r\\n2. For the audience, the default settings are microphone muted, and camera disabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis would reduce the risk of someone joining with the camera or mic on.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tip #3: Use the apps & tools in MS teams\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a plethora of apps on MS teams but my favorite is the polls app. You have a bunch of options within polls that would enable you to conduct \\r\\n1. polls\\r\\n2. anonymous polls\\r\\n3. quiz\\r\\n4. word cloud\\r\\n\\r\\nMy next favorite is not an app but a setting on meeting options. Checking `Q&A` would enable you to show the question and answers tab. You can allow the audience to ask questions\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ask questions anonymously\\r\\n2. Ask questions\\r\\n3. Ask questions but allow questions that go through moderation. \\r\\n\\r\\nModeration is a tricky tool. If there is a moderation delay, then the audience asking questions could be disappointed. You can allow/disallow the audience to react to the question. That would act like feedback to the questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tip #4: Use the raise hand feature to interact with the audience\\r\\n\\r\\nIf more than one person is talking on the microphone at the same time. It could be a race-around condition and such things are to be avoided in a professional meeting. It\'s better to ask the audience to raise hands through teams and then we can ask a moderator to allow their microphone. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf a person is spamming with raised hands, we can put their hand down as well. Here is the workflow.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Allow the audience to enter the meeting as attendees\\r\\n2. If an attendee wants to ask a question to the presenter, ask them to raise their hand on the teams\\r\\n3. Once a raised hand is spotted, the moderator can unmute their microphone for interaction\\r\\n4. If an attendee wants to present/share their screen, we can ask the moderator to promote them as presenters.\\r\\n5. Once the attendee has finished his interaction, the moderator needs to do some cleanup activity like disabling the microphone or revoking his presenter access.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tip #5: Have a meeting plan\\r\\n\\r\\n> Failing to plan is planning to fail\\r\\n\\r\\n> Use your brain to avoid the pain\\r\\n\\r\\n> A bad plan is better than no plan\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wonderful quotes they are, I adore them. I wish I could write them on the office wall. But here is the summary of a bad plan. The meeting starts late and attendees are left in silence for a decent amount of time. When they are about to drop out, they are given some content with no key takeaways or context. The worst part is a bad meeting running late even after the end time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here is what you can do to avoid the shame of a bad meeting. Have a\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Pre-meeting plan\\r\\n2. meeting plan\\r\\n3. Post-meeting plan\\r\\n\\r\\n### Pre-meeting plan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key parts of the pre-meeting plan are \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Identify the right date and time for the meeting\\r\\n2. Identify the topics of discussion\\r\\n3. Identify presenters and moderators\\r\\n4. Prepare an introduction for the panel or guests\\r\\n5. Plan for contingencies like power cuts or bad networks\\r\\n\\r\\n### Meeting plan\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Identify sections of the meeting along with the time\\r\\n2. Have games to play with the attendees to break the monotony\\r\\n3. Have preset questions to discuss in the Q&A part\\r\\n4. Prepare a closing speech\\r\\n5. Share notes and key takeaways\\r\\n\\r\\n### Post meeting plan\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Send the attendees detailed minutes of the meeting\\r\\n2. Send the attendees the solutions to unanswered questions after your research\\r\\n3. Ensure the attendees remember your brand/product\\r\\n4. Ask the attendees to join the appropriate team\'s channel\\r\\n5. Ask them for feedback and reward them\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nRunning successful meetings can be hard. It\'s even harder when your audience never expected or does not have a pain that you can solve. My mantra is\\r\\n\\r\\n> Keep your attendee expectations low but keep your content quality high\\r\\n\\r\\nTake away for you\\r\\n\\r\\n1. If you do a good job, there is a possibility of a repeat audience attending future meetings.\\r\\n2. MS team is a tool, as a meeting organizer, you are expected to know the tool in detail.\\r\\n3. Have a co-organizer moderate the meeting or contingency.\\r\\n4. Use the right mix of apps, content, and features to bring in interactivity.\\r\\n5. More than the tool/MS teams it\'s your energy, passion, and content that matters the most."},{"id":"/docusaurus-in-3-paragraphs","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/docusaurus-in-3-paragraphs","source":"@site/blog/docusaurus-in-3-paragraphs.md","title":"Docusaurus - in <p/> * 3","description":"What is Docusaurus","date":"2022-07-18T15:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"site-generator","permalink":"/blog/tags/site-generator"},{"inline":true,"label":"react","permalink":"/blog/tags/react"},{"inline":true,"label":"markdown","permalink":"/blog/tags/markdown"},{"inline":true,"label":"documentation","permalink":"/blog/tags/documentation"}],"readingTime":0.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Docusaurus - in <p/> * 3","tags":["site-generator","react","markdown","documentation"],"date":"2022-07-18T15:30:00.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"5 tips to Organize meetings at scale with MS teams at your organization","permalink":"/blog/organizing-larger-meetings-on-teams"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to prevent focus scroll in react ref?","permalink":"/blog/How-to-prevent-focus-scroll-in-react-ref"}},"content":"## What is Docusaurus\\r\\n\\r\\nA `react` based static site generator which is modern and developed at `facebook`.

Decided to give it a try. Here is how the day 1 of remix went by. Spoiler alert: It was bumpy.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What are the cool things about [remix.run](https://remix.run)?\\n\\nHere are a few selling points or cool things about [remix.run](https://remix.run)\\n\\n1. Remix is a full stack typescript based framework. No more npm init and installing, configuring, troubleshooting, etc.\\n2. Remix loves React. No need to learn another new view library.\\n3. Remix is fast, thanks to caching, nested routes & loaders.\\n4. React stacks is a great idea and cut down set up issues if everything works normally.\\n\\n## What were the things that did not go well on DX?\\n\\nIn spite of a great landing page, the code snippets on the site seem to be broken. For instance, the code was written for a older version of remix and the same code snippet would not work with `@latest`. \\n\\nThe documentation takes you to example apps like `indie stack` or `jokes app` which kind of give an idea about the full stack framework. But again, the code snippets seem to be broken. It made me wonder if the authors would maintain or abandon the project.\\n\\n## Creating the first hello world with [remix.run](https://remix.run)\\n\\nThis step was simply brilliant, similar to create react app. But the developer has to choose between stack or the basic version. Later, the app is ready with integration, build tasks, etc.\\n\\nThe Code had mix of client and server stuff. In some places the client and server were in the same module. The hello world did not cover anything advanced or highlight the capabilities of full stack, to check them out. The developers are expected to try `jokes app` or `blog tutorial`.\\n\\nI was interested in `blog tutorial` but the code on the documentation would not work in the IDE. I mean, the code snippets need to be updated.\\n\\n## Discuss basic folder structure.\\n\\nThe code which was written in the remix scaffold was perfected. Lots to learn and get inspired.\\n\\nI was working with remix version `1.3.4` and here is how the code was organized. There were 5 folders and 5 files in the root folder.\\n\\n1. `.cache` - yes the cache folder is used for development but the contents are git-ignored.\\n2. `app` - contains the code for frontend and backend.\\n   1. `routes` - doubles down as route on the browser and also API\\n3. `build` - server side build files are stored in this folder. Contents are git-ignored.\\n4. `node_modules`\\n5. `public` - static files related to the client\\n6. Files\\n   1. `.eslintrc`\\n   2. `.gitignore`\\n   3. `package.json`\\n   4. `remix.config.js`\\n   5. `tsconfig.json`\\n\\nBy default, the `.git` repository is not initialized after scaffold.\\n\\n## React stacks\\n\\nThats the topic for tomorrow. As of now, its easy to get confused between which one to learn first. Is it the jokes app or the indie stack. When I was learning, the indie stack code snippet would not work.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n- Remix is a good idea for fullstack arena\\n- Remix code snippets wont work out of the box. They are not backward compatible or need to be updated with latest version of remix. This makes me wonder how to update and maintain remix apps.\\n- For a newbie, asking to choose stacks and others while scaffolding seems to be a ardous task."},{"id":"/How-do-you-decide-if-you-need-a-custom-hook","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/How-do-you-decide-if-you-need-a-custom-hook","source":"@site/blog/How-do-you-decide-if-you-need-a-custom-hook.md","title":"How do you decide if you need a custom React hook","description":"React developers","date":"2022-03-06T19:58:46.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":2.65,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How do you decide if you need a custom React hook","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2022-03-06T19:58:46.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Day 1: Learning remix, setup and issues discussed","permalink":"/blog/Day-1-Learning-remix-setup-and-issues-discussed"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why do we need React.forwardRef","permalink":"/blog/Why-do-we-need-React-forwardRef"}},"content":"![React developers](./assets/react-custom-hooks-developers.webp)\\n\\nHundreds of React tutorials and videos directly start with a custom hook. Here is my experience, where I had to write a custom react hook for the first time. Sharing the rationale and logic behind the first custom react hook.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n ## Is custom hook similar to JS functions? \\n\\nLet us say you have 2 react components that have different JSX but a similar/duplicated hooks logic. The code might be the same or similar `useEffect` code or similar operations on `useState`. In that case, we can move the code to a separate React custom hook. This is similar to our `util` pattern. In the `util` pattern we pull out code that was written in multiple places into a single module. Then call the functions from the `util` file. The `util` pattern is good enough for Javascript but React and react fiber is inefficient. We need custom hooks.\\n\\nCustom hooks have simple rules, to begin with.\\n\\n1. The name of the custom hook should start with `use`.\\n2. The custom hook can call/make use of other hooks in its body.\\n3. The custom hook can return any data type like normal functions.\\n\\nWriting custom hooks is not different from Javascript functions except for the semantics of the hooks. For instance, the custom hook can be called inside react components, they cannot be inside a branching statement or loop-like any other React hooks. However, we do not have such limitations in `util` methods.\\n\\n## Why custom hook?\\n\\nThe `how-to` write custom hook has been discussed over and over at conferences and by React influencers many times. In 2022, react developers should be in a position to identify hooks in libraries like `nextJS`. I mean to say, hooks are everywhere. Be it your office code or inside libraries.\\n\\nBefore you write a custom hook, understand why we need one. It\'s easy to over-engineer the code and make it complex. If your code does not look like a story, something is incorrect.\\n\\n> When you spot repetitive hooks related code, it\'s an ideal candidate for a custom hook.\\n\\n## How to test a custom hook?\\n\\nThis is another area where the `how-to` articles do not meet my expectation. Once you have spotted repetitive React hooks code and built your custom hook. We need to get the hook under the unit test.\\n\\nThe challenge with testing custom hooks comes with the hook\'s semantics. The hooks can be called from react components only. The test case or `it block` is not a react component so the custom hook cannot be invoked. \\n\\nIn `react testing library` we have a method called `renderHook`. According to [render hook documentation](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/reference/api#renderhook), the `renderHook` gives a test component or I would say a host component for the custom hook to be rendered.\\n\\nThe return of `renderHook` is an `object`.\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  all: Array<any>\\n  current: any,\\n  error: Error\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n- Deciding on when you should promote your component logic to custom hook is critical for scaling and testing the React code\\n- Writing a custom hook is not scary. It\'s natural like JS functions with some twists."},{"id":"/Why-do-we-need-React-forwardRef","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Why-do-we-need-React-forwardRef","source":"@site/blog/Why-do-we-need-React-forwardRef.md","title":"Why do we need React.forwardRef","description":"React forward ref","date":"2022-02-07T10:59:36.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":1.61,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why do we need React.forwardRef","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2022-02-07T10:59:36.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How do you decide if you need a custom React hook","permalink":"/blog/How-do-you-decide-if-you-need-a-custom-hook"},"nextItem":{"title":"Finding inspiration for mid-level developers online","permalink":"/blog/Finding-inspiration-for-mid-level-developers-online"}},"content":"![React forward ref](./assets/react-forward-ref.webp)\\n\\nThe best thing about React props is the ability to send different data structures from parent to child without any code configuration like `@input` etc. But why do we need an extra construct `React.forwardRef` for passing ref? let us find out.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Where is `React.forwardRef` used?\\n\\nIt\'s used when we are passing `ref` as a prop to functional components\\n\\n## What is `React.forwardRef`?\\n\\nIt is a way to create a component. At a high level, React forwardRef takes 2 arguments\\n\\n1. props that are to be passed to the child component\\n2. ref that needs to be passed to the child component\\n\\n## Why do we need `React.forwardRef`?\\n\\nIn functional components, we cannot instantiate the components. Instantiating components is a feature offered by class-based components in React. But we want to be able to use `Ref` in functional components. The ability to instantiate functional components and assign the value to `ref.current` is provided by `React.forwardRef`\\n\\nIf you are using class-based components, then we need not use React.forwardRef to accept ref as a prop.\\n\\n## What is the structure of the `ref`\\n\\nLet\'s understand who we create a `ref`\\n\\n- Inside functional components, we use `useRef` hook.\\n- Outside of functional components, we use `React.createRef`\\n\\nThe ref object has the following structure\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n    current: null\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen the component is instantiated, the element reference is stored in current. When the component is destroyed, the `current` points to `null`.\\n\\nTo access the ref contents we can do \\n\\n```javascript\\nconst {value} = ref?.current;  \\n```\\n\\n## Why do we need refs?\\n\\nWe need ref to do `DOM` stuff like selection, querying, and animations. Instead of using `document.getElementById` or any `DOM` queries, we can use `ref` which are reliable in React.\\n\\n\\n## Can we pass multiple refs to React.forwardRef?\\n\\nWe can pass through a callback function. The return of the callback function should contain the ref objects.\\n\\n```typescript jsx\\nconst multiRef = () => ({\\n    ref1: React.createRef<HTMLInputElement>(),\\n    ref2: React.createRef<HTMLInputElement>()\\n})\\n```"},{"id":"/Finding-inspiration-for-mid-level-developers-online","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Finding-inspiration-for-mid-level-developers-online","source":"@site/blog/Finding-inspiration-for-mid-level-developers-online.md","title":"Finding inspiration for mid-level developers online","description":"experienced developer","date":"2022-01-25T11:43:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"}],"readingTime":2.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Finding inspiration for mid-level developers online","tags":["learning"],"date":"2022-01-25T11:43:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why do we need React.forwardRef","permalink":"/blog/Why-do-we-need-React-forwardRef"},"nextItem":{"title":"Perils of updating npm libs & our safety net","permalink":"/blog/Perils-of-updating-npm-libs-our-safety-net"}},"content":"![experienced developer](./assets/exp-developer.webp)\\n\\nTo do the imperceptible, we need inspiration. For a novice, the internet is flooded with boot camps, how-to videos, etc. But as we become mid-level developers, we need a different level of education which is hard to find and even harder to derive value out of it. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What is the current state of educational material online?\\n\\nInformation is mostly in \\n\\n1. Video formats\\n2. Print and books\\n3. Github or source code\\n\\nThe video formats are mostly entry-level. They are almost deciphering the documentation for the entry-level developers who love to see for themselves before exploring stuff.\\n\\nPrint is mostly what we see on the websites of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. They are mostly up-to-date. Sometimes, the concepts may be explained shallowly but it\'s not just understanding but the mental model is important to retain the concepts for a long time.\\n\\n> Don\'t ask me why React still has class-based examples even after hooks are out for a while. \\n\\nBooks are still the best way to get the content out in a well-defined, edited format for experts. The books market is muffled with free ebooks, early releases, promotional material, etc you will get by signing up for a newsletter or books which are written over a weekend on some particular topic. Finding a good book is a challenge for most of us. Some books have an associated web version which is mostly kept up to date. \\n\\nNot all the code is equal nor provides good inspiration unless you spend time skimming.\\n\\n## Where is the material for mid-level developers?\\n\\nAs a mid-level developer, here are the places I look for inspiration\\n\\n1. Reflection and thinking about stuff/concepts - For instance, learning Vue was easy because I knew how to React works. Just some reflection and alignment of conceptual understanding were required. The same with any concept in the programming world. Compare Dockerfile with package.json etc.\\n2. Curiosity, after a while the workplace does not put pressure to learn new stuff. That\'s where the curious mind kicks in. Do not let curiosity die.\\n3. Books that are intended for mid-level expertise on a subject / have professionals in their title are good enough. Bye podcasts, youtube, and any ad-filled or ad-backed content. I may not need you in long run. In the short run, as a reference for a quick how-to, this content is great.\\n\\n> In the long run we need to train how to learn by ourselves. That\'s how you are going to get accustomed to a new codebase or esoteric library that a real team uses.\\n\\n4. Github is like the museum and expo in software programming. From the latest to archived projects, we have everything in one place. Be there on Github often and observe others\' work.\\n5. Conference talks are cool, why miss them. After all, someone prepares and is willing to share their experience. This is the kind of youtube video I want mid-level developers to watch."},{"id":"/Perils-of-updating-npm-libs-our-safety-net","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Perils-of-updating-npm-libs-our-safety-net","source":"@site/blog/Perils-of-updating-npm-libs-our-safety-net.md","title":"Perils of updating npm libs & our safety net","description":"Do npm update","date":"2022-01-22T18:19:29.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":3.43,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Perils of updating npm libs & our safety net","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2022-01-22T18:19:29.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Finding inspiration for mid-level developers online","permalink":"/blog/Finding-inspiration-for-mid-level-developers-online"},"nextItem":{"title":"Experience with magzter subscription in India 2022","permalink":"/blog/Experience-with-magzter-subscription-in-India-2022"}},"content":"![Do npm update](./assets/npm-update.webp)\\n\\nAs a senior developer or an architect, one of the job demands would be to update the `npm-packages` of your application. Ironically there is no one single command which would start the update and end the update with all finesse and grace the application would need. here are a few lessons from my job on updating npm packages.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What are `npm-packages`?\\n\\nThe javascript code is organized into modules. The modules can be reused, across the org or the community. Then with the birth of npm and GitHub. the open-source synergies got together. we got focussed, functional and well-engineered Javascript modules packaged as npm packages.\\n\\nthe package is slightly different from a module. The npm package has a couple of obligatory files like `package.json`, sticks to a particular format like common, etc.\\n\\nThe npm package has a bunch of identifiers\\n\\n1. a unique name\\n2. a version number\\n3. a sha id associated with the release\\n\\nEach of the above identifiers serves a purpose. The unique name is for identifying the package among the crowd of packages. The version number aka `semver` number is for release management. The sha id ensures the integrity of the bundle and ensures it\'s not tampered with malicious intent.\\n\\n## Best practices while working with dependent npm-packages\\n\\n> Updates are easy but upgrades are risky. But even a simple npm install could break the application when one dependency pulls the package out of the npm or a corrupt version takes the seat.\\n\\n- We need to appreciate what the tools like `npm` already give us. Things like \\n  - `^` for compatible changes only, suites well-established packages which pass through alpha, beta, and RC\\n  - `~` for close-to changes only, suites for semi-popular packages\\n  - defined version for a package you found with little to low activity and maintained by solo developers. The chances of the solo developer making a breaking change are high due to a lack of review.\\n  - `*` do not use it\\n  > `npm i` and we need to check and assign `^ ~` or the absence of the prefixes.\\n- The semver numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt. They are a guideline but nothing stops the developer from accidentally pushing a change that breaks the contract established by the previous version.\\n- Updates not performed over time are a `tech debt`. Not every team or product has the luxury to be debt-free. It is okay to live with debt unless the team is excited to be cutting edge (which happens all the time, it is hard to hire good talent for old tech) or the business is losing something significant.\\n- Before updating npm packages, I would look at 2 important pieces of the problem.\\n  - application performance & integrity\\n  - developer experience\\n  > I would not shake up dependencies and dev dependencies on the same day.\\n- CI or continuous integration should check if the app dependencies are available (on a new network) and the app can start once the code leaves the developer machine.\\n- When the package has a version like `^16.1.0`, and you do `npm i` you may get `16.8.0` installed. That is risky because we invited 7 minor changes to API in our code base. In this case, it\'s better to stick with a defined version.\\n\\n## Npm update on the command line\\n\\n- Run `npm outdated`, pick the number you want to upgrade or update to.\\n- Pick one package at a time unless the use case like babel upgrade demands multi-package updates at the same time\\n- update the number on package JSON (defined version instead of `^`)\\n- Run the application, check if the scope, test cases, and other CI passes through.\\n\\nOther tools like `npm-check-update` or `renovate` speed up the risky process. Updating packages is best when done slowly with some operating procedures. I have broken my blog many times because of speedy npm-package upgrades/updates.\\n\\n> Keep the update activity known only to your local machine. You have a lot of time to investigate if things go bad. Downtime of dev or Jenkins build would raise a flag in some dev teams."},{"id":"/Experience-with-magzter-subscription-in-India-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Experience-with-magzter-subscription-in-India-2022","source":"@site/blog/Experience-with-magzter-subscription-in-India-2022.md","title":"Experience with magzter subscription in India 2022","description":"reading magazines","date":"2022-01-21T11:34:30.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"}],"readingTime":2.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Experience with magzter subscription in India 2022","tags":["learning"],"date":"2022-01-21T11:34:30.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Perils of updating npm libs & our safety net","permalink":"/blog/Perils-of-updating-npm-libs-our-safety-net"},"nextItem":{"title":"Tech tools used by design technology teams at work in 2022","permalink":"/blog/Tech-tools-used-by-design-technology-teams-at-work-in-2022"}},"content":"![reading magazines](./assets/reading-mag.webp)\\n\\nEver since covid started, the information stimuli is restricted to a few topics. Meeting friends or colleagues and discussing the happenings is a habit on the brink of extinction. Internet is good at recommending information but rarely a great tool for discovering something of interest or value. So I turned to a magazine subscription on **Magzter**. Here is my experience.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Why online magazine subscription with Magzter?\\n\\nPrint media was battered by online media since 2010. With high-speed internet and instant media reach, the print magazines unless backed by a large user base could not sustain. they shut the shop.\\n\\nSame with the newspaper which reduced their content to cut costs and increased the daily print prices to compensate for increased costs. As a consumer, I paid more for lesser content.\\n\\nMagzter is a one-stop subscription for newspapers and magazines. It\'s not exhaustive but good enough to keep the information stimuli coming in.\\n\\n## Avoid the individual subscription mess\\n\\nMagzter can be compared to NetFlix where you do not have to buy individual tickets for each movie. I can buy one subscription and read the content for the duration of the subscription.\\n\\n> Learn the art of negotiating subscription costs when you buy a subscription online. Don\'t pay on day 1 after the free trial, give them a run. they will get you a sweeter deal over email or SMS.\\n\\nI did the same with Magzter, took a free trial. At the end of the free trial, I kept visiting the site. I think they extended the free trial. After an extended free trial, I left the site for a while but they kept reaching me with better and thinner packages. Of course, the discounted subscription has some frills removed but it does the job.\\n\\nAt the cost of subscribing to one newspaper a year, I subscribed to a bouquet of magazines and newspapers. I got a custom plan for 1200 automatically renewed every year.\\n\\n## Pros of Magzter\\n\\n- Apps are great, I read on my tab and it does the job.\\n- Favorited magazines or newspapers get downloaded automatically\\n- Does a job like\\n  - tech mag - T3\\n  - news - plenty of them\\n  - financial - plenty of them\\n- Can read content from another country when allowed to.\\n\\n## Cons of Magzter\\n- I could not fully understand the subscriptions plans like lite, gold. Does lite mean only newspapers or selected magazines? I don\'t know.\\n- The content is going to get slimmer as most publishing houses are shutting shops.\\n- Some of the niche players like Deccan herald are not on the platform.\\n- I see buy on few magazines even though I have subscribed.

Bootstrap is a popular design tech repository we can relate to. Most popular companies have their design libraries developed in-house and to be used within the organization.\\n\\n## What\'s the experience and background of design tech teams?\\n\\nDesign tech teams are essentially small groups of members with the senior and above level of experience either in design or in frontend specialization or someone with interest in frontend. The design tech teams have 3 variants of engineers.\\n\\n1. People who do the design for a large part of their job\\n2. People who do design and little coding\\n3. People who do coding and less of design work\\n\\nI have not seen a dedicated QA team member in design tech teams, most of the testing happens at the PR stage.\\n\\n## What are the terms used in design tech teams?\\n\\nHere are the top 10 terms developers hear at the design tech teams\\n\\n1. UI components\\n2. Variants\\n3. Edge case\\n4. Accessibility\\n5. Meetings\\n6. Mockup\\n7. Markup\\n8. Details\\n9. Npm package\\n10. React or whatever mainstream library we develop the components in\\n\\n## What are the tools and tech used in design tech teams?\\n\\nIDE - VS code or Webstorm\\nFrontend - HTML, CSS, ES Next, Typescript\\nView lib - React or whatever the whole org has agreed to use\\nTooling - Babel with bundler\\nDisplay components - storybook\\nUnit tests - React testing lib, puppeteer, Jest\\nVersion control - whatever the org decides to use, mostly GitHub\\nNpm package repo - whatever the org decides to use, sometimes npmjs\\nHardware - mostly macs, sometimes windows pro\\n\\n## Tools that you won\'t find at the design tech repository?\\n\\nMostly we don\'t have to communicate with the backend like actual product teams so there would be no\\n\\n1. Redux\\n2. Redux logger\\n3. Redux middleware\\n4. Router\\n5. Selector lib\\n6. User journey mapping\\n7. Making mockups for specific products\\n\\n## Trends in design tech libraries\\n\\n1. Each component along with its variants is hosted as a separate npm package.\\n2. The community contribution is kept in a separate package and consumed separately if required\\n3. Documentation of the requirement and why a design decision was taken\\n4. Engaging with the community with events, video courses, and mailers\\n5.

It\'s completely a front-end job. It has been more than 90 days since I moved into this job and here is my learning experiences. Here are my top 10 learning experiences from my new job role as \\"Lead design technologist\\".\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Short intro to your new job role\\n\\nThe job title is \\"Lead design technologist\\". The work is about translating Figma designs to working react components. These components should cater to UX needs, UI needs, and accessibility.\\n\\nHere are the primary job roles\\n\\n1. Work with a distributed team of developers to develop EDL in React\\n2. Develop React components with multiple variants showcased in storybook\\n3. Lead the tech initiatives at repo like typescript migrations\\n4. Plan the npm package releases\\n5. Work on code quality, unit tests, visual tests, and issues downhill like CSS libraries.\\n\\nOther auxiliary roles would be\\n\\n1. Consult with product teams when they have set up issues with the EDL library\\n2. Check with product teams when they have an enhancement request\\n3. Work on defects\\n4. Promote EDL library in internal events & with marketing teams.\\n\\n## Learnings on the job\\n\\n1. We work on 100% React most of the time. Another team takes care of vanilla JS and CSS.\\n2. We touch base on not so popular react APIs like forwarding refs and refs\\n3. We are fully into functional components and hooks with typescript\\n4. Typescript migration can be hard when half of the components are in JS. But that calls for a better migration plan.\\n5. Remote teams only get a few hours for synchronous communication. That cannot be lost for normal stuff like stand-up meetings, instead, focus on architecture discussions or design discussions.\\n6. Building components can be overlooked as something simple. If the developer is not cautious, you can easily complicate with not-so-obvious props, variants, etc. When things enter the erroneous zone, back off and have a discussion.\\n7. Enhanced takes more time than development because it\'s another variant and an increased number of props is not a good developer experience.\\n8. We expect developers to write very minimal markup, that is why we are building a library.\\n9. Starter apps are critical for easing the barriers and increasing adoption.\\n10. Lab or demo storybook repository helps us to check out the library with popular libraries out there before the developers spot the bugs.\\n\\n\\n## Tough parts of the job\\n\\n1. Accessibility is another reason people use EDL components, as the EDL library developer I need to ensure the accessibility aspects are in place. The issue is that accessibility testing can be hard and not many experts are around to discuss accessibility.\\n2. The community expects the repository maintainers to be quick, flexible, and nice to their pull requests. Especially if the pull request is an enhancement, it\'s going to take a few weeks to get merged because it needs a design team review.\\n3. Adoption of EDL is hard especially when we have multiple versions. The teams seldom migrate to the latest because of tech debt or difficulties with migrations. The new teams choose to build their components because the new components are a better match for their design thinking. This is detrimental to the enterprise design language philosophy.\\n\\n## Next steps for me\\n\\n1. Get better at tech initiatives\\n2. Get better at the leading team of developers especially when they are in a timezone that has very less overlap with yours\\n3. Get out of your comfort zone and spread the buzz about the EDL and the repo."},{"id":"/stages-in-Ecmascript-and-how-it-relates-to-Javascript","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/stages-in-Ecmascript-and-how-it-relates-to-Javascript","source":"@site/blog/stages-in-Ecmascript-and-how-it-relates-to-Javascript.md","title":"stages in Ecmascript and how it relates to Javascript","description":"Ecmascript and JavaScript","date":"2021-11-27T23:21:23.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":1.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"stages in Ecmascript and how it relates to Javascript","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2021-11-27T23:21:23.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Experiences from first 100 days as a lead design technologist","permalink":"/blog/Experiences-from-first-100-days-as-a-lead-design-technologist"},"nextItem":{"title":"Here is how replacing RSS feeds with JS twitter influencers helped me to stay updated","permalink":"/blog/Here-is-how-replacing-RSS-feeds-with-JS-twitter-influencers-helped-me-to-stay-updated"}},"content":"![Ecmascript and JavaScript](./assets/ecmascript-relates-JS.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us say you drop a cheque at the local bank, it goes through several stages and finally, you get your money.

It comes in handy when you are screen sharing and your family photos show up.\\n- A sleek business casual wallpaper that appeals to your taste, and it\'s not going to make it notorious while screen sharing.\\n\\n### Tasks I won\'t merge with my official workstation\\n\\n- Photos from cameras won\'t meet my official laptop.\\n- Movie collection, music collection, etc will not be on the official hard drive\\n- Social media used to be kept at a bare minimum\\n- Keep caution while downloading digital content\\n- Won\'t spin up media center software etc\\n\\n## Can you let go of your laptop completely?\\n\\nNot, it will remain. But I might not upgrade my laptop. Maybe I shall upgrade my mobile device with better storage or buy accessories to make it more capable of handling workflows.\\n\\nCan I read the SD card from my mobile device? Why not, read more about Samsung DeX Desktop Experiences.

The question has no clear answer, and it remains a conundrum. Talk to any job hunting engineering freshers, they would say nobody gives me a job, but they want to have working experience.

It means employees give rest to their tools and go home with gifts. Even tools and machines are given rest in my society. I got a message on LinkedIn about someone looking for a job and he has no Ayudha pooja because he is not an employee. Technically someone is not happy. I want to help that person get a job because I had been there as an interviewee and interviewer many times in my career now. \\n\\n> Job is a 3 letter word which attracts the other 2 words love & money. So why not help someone get a job.\\n\\n## Why do engineering students won\'t get a job and it\'s a problem?\\n\\n1. Students join engineering to have a middle-class life and not out of the passion to engineer products or solutions. Most of the time it\'s a unanimous choice presented to students after school education.\\n\\n2. Colleges don\'t teach economics or finances or job hunting. \\n\\n> Why not dedicate one subject in any semester for job hunting when we know that we are going to be job hunting and working for the rest of our lives?\\n\\nIt\'s the job of parents and neighbors to remind the students to get a job and get into the economy. \\n\\n3. Life skills cannot be taught. They have to be explored, absorbed, and gained from the words of wise. Students find the words of the wise boring.\\n\\n## What is the solution?\\n\\n1. After spending 4 years at college and not finding a job? then take a shot by spending another year\'s worth of tuition fee (or sometimes lesser) at the job-oriented training businesses.\\n\\n**Downside** You are going to be out of the job for some months after college and most likely to get an entry-level job with a lesser wage compared to campus hires. You are losing time and money.\\n\\n> There is no guarantee of a job after training. It\'s like extended and rigorous college again. Pay, study, learn but the things used at work. Mostly taught by IITians of India because IIT is a recognized & respected word in the Indian education system. It\'s like training straight from the horse\'s mouth (it\'s business right! they show the sunny side first and call it ads).\\n\\n\\n2. While studying at college you should have asked the right questions? The right questions would have been, what should I do to get a job. Of course, not every student is going to be in a premier institute in some computer science-related course. You might be a BSC in Computer science from a college built in the countryside that nobody is aware of. The answer while studying is to go \\n   1. take up programming classes\\n   2. get mentored by a working professional\\n   3. read books that are read by professionals.\\n   4. know the tools and languages the workplace needs\\n   5. Develop some application or product with the tools and languages identified above.\\n   6. Engineer & Execute the project.\\n\\nIf you have done any 2 steps mentioned above, your resume would be different from million other engineers out there looking for a job.\\n\\n> Good questions get great answers. But a question like can you refer me & he is my (give me a job) resume, is not a good one.\\n\\n## I missed the campus placement, what should I do?\\n\\nSome of the freshers are going to get a job soon because their resume looks good, they have experience with tools and languages at work.\\n\\n> Experience beats inexperience every single time in the IT field.\\n\\nA fresher with professional knowledge of java or javascript is going to get a job quicker than a guy who started taking up tutorials after college.\\n\\nBite the bullet, you are going to lose time and money. Instead of reading all by yourself, join a training house that can transform you from novice to job-ready professional.\\n\\n## Who is a job-ready professional\\n\\n> A job-ready professional can do the minimum viable product alone which he would be doing at work & getting paid for.\\n\\nIf you are a backend developer, you should be in a position to build web services, integrate with the database with ORM, handle minimum authentication and debug issues. That\'s the bare minimum expected out of you.\\n\\nIf you are a frontend developer, you should be able to translate mockup into a working web app\\n\\nThat said if you are going to be a tester or QA. Then you should be able to identify and write test cases for the product.\\n\\n## Why you will not become a job-ready professional?\\n\\n   1. Many people do not have the discipline to painstakingly think and take the right decisions required to get a job.\\n\\n   2. Many people do not have the discipline to prepare for a job interview in the right way. The right way is coding an app and learning in the context of the app.\\n\\n   3. Many people are not going to take the risk of taking money out for a training class. In step 1 you should have identified all possible options to get to your goal. If you are good at step 2 then step 3 can be avoided.\\n\\n   4. Of course, you still have to get familiar with interview questions and answers from google.\\n\\n   5. Soft skills matter.\\n\\n## Common questions which fresher without a job asks.\\n\\n1. Why can\'t companies hire and give training\\n\\n   Your college did not teach you how IT companies work. IT companies have project timelines and budgets. Not all companies have the luxury to intake you, train, and give you a project.\\n  \\n2. Will I get the job if I learn Javascript/Python\\n\\n   Nobody is going to give you a job because you learned React/python/JS. You get a job when you can demonstrate that you can build products with your learning or solve a business problem.\\n  \\n3. Why I won\'t get interview calls?\\n\\n   Either the recruiters do not know that you exist or they do not want you.\\n  \\n4. Why recruiters don\'t call me back after the interview?\\n\\n   As an interviewer, I have given feedback to a lot of candidates. Your interview boils down to numbers like your CGPA. If you are 3.5/5 and other candidates have 4.5 then that person gets the job. In few cases, other factors like likeability, because you are living close by or gender preferences, might also be an issue.\\n  \\n5. How to get a good job as a fresher?\\n\\n   Take a look at senior IT professionals\' resumes on LinkedIn or elsewhere. That\'s how your resume should look except for the employer history. You should have used tools and languages to solve problems rather than learning things.\\n  \\n> Let go of the fresher tag, skip the junior dev role altogether by training for senior roles, bring real skills to the table.\\n\\n6. I am technically good, but nobody gives me a job. Why?\\n\\n   Who cares if you know technology \'X\' 100 percent or not. What matters is if you can solve a business problem most efficiently.\\n\\n7. Which tutorial should I use for learning Javascript\\n\\n   If you are only learning, I do not think you are going to be a job-ready professional. Write some real code.\\n\\n## Questions that freshers rarely ask\\n\\n1. Am I fit for the IT industry\\n\\n   IT industry is a laborious industry. Sitting before a PC for many long hours is not for everyone. You should ask yourself if you are passionate about computers or tech. Many freshers look at IT as a job house instead of a career which is demanding and lucrative for hard-working folks\\n\\n2. What are the hiring trends\\n\\n  - Hacker earth route\\n  - DS and algo rounds\\n  - white board coding\\n  - blog checks\\n  - github checks\\n  - technical speaker\\n  - oral communication\\n  - written communication\\n  - assignment round\\n  - telephonic rounds\\n\\nEach trend has its pros and cons but you need to prepare for as many of them.\\n\\n3. what are the soft skills a candidate should have\\n\\n   The candidate should be able to comfortably introduce himself/herself to the recruiter in less than 90 seconds in an impressive manner. Narrating a resume won\'t help. Obsessing about hobbies is not good either. It\'s a business pitch ideally.\\n\\n   Don\'t bore the interviewer. Don\'t fake or fudge information. Interviewers can find out that you are fake.\\n\\n4. Should I listen to that guy who mentioned back door entry?\\n\\n   Backdoor entries are a no-no. You can be kicked out anytime or called for a re-interview which is going to be many times harder and embarrassing than the normal one.\\n\\n5. How much should you learn for the interview.\\n\\n   Learn 1x but prepare 2x. If you do not know the difference between learning and preparing for the interview then you are in serious trouble. Consult your mentor or read 5 books on job interviews.\\n\\n6. I am job hunting for 6 months and exhausted all my options?\\n  \\n   were you using the same resume for 6 months? were you searching for the same job for 6 months? why not change something. I would do A/B testing and see what works and what would not. But most importantly change something. Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting different results.\\n\\n7. What should I do when hunting for a job\\n\\n   Job hunting is not a job. So fill it up by building products or solutions or do open source.\\n\\n8. Should I pay for getting interview calls?\\n\\n   Maybe yes, because you do not have the guts to identify IT companies and walk into their office with your cover letter explaining why they should hire you. Some business owners would like you because they do not have to pay the middle man if you walk into their door with a good offer.\\n\\n9. What are things freshers do not know about hiring\\n\\n- hiring is an expensive business activity\\n- hiring numbers are decided in advance\\n- cooperation with the hiring team is important\\n- the more valuable you\'re skillset is to the business, the higher would be your pay.\\n- very rarely do people hire you because you learned one library. Because in production level apps, many such libraries are working together with each other.\\n\\n10. How do I impress the recruiter\\n\\n  - Infographic resume\\n  - Portfolio of past work\\n  - Open source contribution\\n  - High quality work experience\\n  - Professionalism\\n\\n11. Should I work for some company for free as a training?\\n\\n   The company should take you on a trial basis but with 50% pay that you would get when hired. In some cases either greed or lack of budget, things might go out of the way. Use your discretion but walking away with a fake experience letter is dangerous. It\'s equivalent to back door entry.\\n\\n12. Should I sign 2 years bond after training?\\n\\n   Maybe yes but you should not surrender your career growth or salary hike during this bond period. Bond is only for retaining you but it should not be for bondage.\\n\\n## References\\n\\nBooks: What Color Is Your Parachute? by Richard Nelson Bolles"},{"id":"/nvm-windows-semifunctional-npm-package-compared-to-actual-node-version-manager-nvm","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/nvm-windows-semifunctional-npm-package-compared-to-actual-node-version-manager-nvm","source":"@site/blog/nvm-windows-semifunctional-npm-package-compared-to-actual-node-version-manager-nvm.md","title":"nvm-windows, useful npm-package similar to node version manager (nvm) but for Windows","description":"nvm windows","date":"2021-10-14T08:14:08.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"npm-packages","permalink":"/blog/tags/npm-packages"}],"readingTime":3.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"nvm-windows, useful npm-package similar to node version manager (nvm) but for Windows","tags":["npm-packages"],"date":"2021-10-14T08:14:08.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Engineering student but no job? are you ready to pay your 5th year tuition fee?","permalink":"/blog/How-engineering-students-can-avoid-spending-their-5th-year-tution-fee-on-job-oriented-trainings"},"nextItem":{"title":"Here is why cross-env npm-package important for your frontend development setup","permalink":"/blog/the-why-what-is-cross-env-npm-package"}},"content":"![nvm windows](./assets/nvm-windows-cover.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobalization is essentially trying to emulate what worked in country A in another country. Similarly, nvm-windows is an attempt to bring the goodness of the popular node version manager (nvm) to the windows operating system. Let us find out what nvm-windows attempts to solve and how it works.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n \\r\\n## Why node version manager?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we have an infant at home, we give the infant different food from what the elders eat. Similarly not all nodeJS codebases are equal. Some are old and need different nodeJS versions which may not be present on your system. A beginner nodeJS developer may work with one version of NodeJS but when you have to work with legacy codebases, then working with different nodeJS versions is an unavoidable step.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisit this amazing website called [node.green](https://node.green/) to find out the nodeJS support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![node green website](./assets/node-green.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is nvm-windows\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the core, nvm-windows is an npm package that helps you run different node versions on your operating system. If you have to do without nvm-windows, then you have to \\r\\n\\r\\n1. uninstall existing node versions from your operating system.\\r\\n2. download the exact version of nodeJS from the nodeJS website\\r\\n3. install the nodeJS version on your machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese steps are laborious and time-consuming. That\'s where nvm-windows come into the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How does nvm-windows work?\\r\\n\\r\\nnvm-windows has an important pre-requisite, you need to uninstall any existing node JS versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nnvm-windows is going to dynamically modify the contents of the node JS folder on your computer every time you run a command.\\r\\n\\r\\n``` bash\\r\\nnvm use v12.12.0 64\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above command is going to \\r\\n\\r\\n1. remove the contents of nodeJS folder from program-files on the windows machine\\r\\n2. download the exact version of nodeJS mentioned on the machine. If it were already downloaded, then this step will be skipped.\\r\\n3. the downloaded version of node JS will be updated in the operating system.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen you run `node --version` then you will be seeing the updated version in your cmd.exe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## architecture of nvm-windows\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding nvm-windows code is hard because it is coded in the `go` language. We can start with the `nvm.go` module and you will see the main function.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![nvm-windows-main](./assets/nvmwindows-main.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe functions are clean and modular. Operating system concepts like signals and symlinks are used. Technically the program files contents are not changed. The environment variable path gets changed to the downloaded and unzipped location. \\r\\n\\r\\n## APIs of nvm-windows\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nvm-windows are not something you would import as a package. Rather it\'s used at shell scripts to control the node version that\'s used for the development or deployment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter installing nvm, we need to turn on the nvm-windows by `nvm on` and similarly turn off with `nvm off`. I have personally not used `nvm off` till now because my machine would lose nodeJS if I do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to mention the valid semver version in command for nvm to download the package along with the architecture of the CPU. Simply 32/64 bit. \\r\\n\\r\\n`nvm install v12.12.0 64`\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce downloaded, we need to ask nvm-windows to use the version of node JS that\'s available. Using `nvm list` you can see the available versions that can be used.\\r\\n\\r\\n`nvm use v12.12.0`\\r\\n\\r\\nThen check the node version with `node --version`\\r\\n\\r\\n## Downsides of nvm-windows\\r\\n\\r\\nIn development teams, it may happen that few team members are not on the mainstream operating system. But as an architect of the product, we need to bring them to the same level in terms of local dependencies and setup. This can be achieved by configuration files. With node version manager we get `.nvmrc` which contains the version of node to be installed for the repository. But nvm-windows won\'t understand `.nvmrc` so we need to keep the version updated in the readme file.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar the nvm is smarter in terms of fetching node versions. `nvm use v12` would fetch the latest version on Mac/Linux but on windows it expects the developer to find the exact semver number and provide it in the command.\\r\\n\\r\\n## About the developer of nvm-windows\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author is Corey Butler who has built amazing oper source products. I am impressed with his meetup called [Bleeding edge](https://www.edgeatx.org/slides/) which happens on the fourth Wednesday every month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documentation on nvm-windows is professional including the production-level scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/coreybutler/node-windows"},{"id":"/the-why-what-is-cross-env-npm-package","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-why-what-is-cross-env-npm-package","source":"@site/blog/the-why-what-is-cross-env-npm-package.md","title":"Here is why cross-env npm-package important for your frontend development setup","description":"cross env post","date":"2021-10-14T07:11:44.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Here is why cross-env npm-package important for your frontend development setup","date":"2021-10-14T07:11:44.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"nvm-windows, useful npm-package similar to node version manager (nvm) but for Windows","permalink":"/blog/nvm-windows-semifunctional-npm-package-compared-to-actual-node-version-manager-nvm"},"nextItem":{"title":"Moved away from Ubuntu 21.04 to Windows 10 pro, here is why?","permalink":"/blog/Moved-away-from-Ubuntu-21-04-to-windows-10-pro-here-is-why"}},"content":"![cross env post](./assets/cross-env-post.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Spanish people can converse normally but a Hindi-speaking Indian and a Spanish person need an intermediate guy or a translator. The same with reading and writing variables across different shells. In npm scrips, we read/write environment/shell variables. But there is no uniform syntax to read/write environment/shell variables which causes errors when the npm task is run across different operating systems. We have a `cross-env` package that solves the problem of reading/writing environment/shell variables on different operating systems elegantly.\\r\\n \\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n \\r\\n> The difference between environment variables and shell variables is that a shell variable is local to a particular instance of the shell (such as a shell script), while environment variables are \\"inherited\\" by any program you start, including another shell\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is cross-env?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a tiny npm package that helps us set and read environment/shell variables across multiple operating systems elegantly. In frontend development, the web assets are generally platform-independent. I mean the web apps work well on all major OS provided they have a browser client installed. The development workflow is vastly based on nodeJS and configurations which need to be set by environment variables or shell variables. The syntax for reading and setting environment/shell variables is dependent on the shell running on the operating system. For instance `git bash` on windows supports Linux-like syntax whereas `cmd` on windows has no clue about that syntax and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why is `cross-env` required?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo read and write environment/shell variables in npm scripts, we need an operating system independent syntax which is given by `cross-env`.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How does `cross-env` work?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the heart of `cross-env` is a nodeJS method that converts the syntax which we used on Windows to match the Linux machine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![command convert method cross env](./assets/command-convert.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to set up and use cross-env?\\r\\n\\r\\ncross-env is added as a dev dependency. \\r\\n\\r\\n`npm install --save-dev cross-env`\\r\\n\\r\\n### To set shell variables\\r\\n\\r\\nTo use `cross-env` we need to call the library from the npm script directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n`npm start: cross-env BUILD_TYPE=dev ...`\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BUILD_TYPE is available in the nodeJS script that follows under `process.env.BUILD_TYPE`\\r\\n\\r\\n### To read shell variables declared elsewhere or in the operating system.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s say we have an environment/shell variable set elsewhere, then we need to use `cross-env-shell` to read the variable. By elsewhere I meant it\'s not on the same npm command.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo give a backdrop, on Linux/mac it\'s `$shellVariable`, and in windows, it\'s `%shellVariable%`. With `cross-env-shell` we can use a single syntax on both the operating systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n`build: cross-env-shell npm version $releaseType`\\r\\n\\r\\nWith cross-env-shell, we can also read the environment variables on the host operating system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Other features of `cross-env`\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall `cross-env` is tiny utility with 2 major apis i.e. `cross-env` and `cross-env-shell`. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have few more features like passing JSON strings as options to the command which I have not tried. We have options to retain the variable read syntax without replacing it with the actual value with help of backslashes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Known issue with `cross-env`\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![shell on windows](./assets/shell-options-windows.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shell on which the commands are run decides how the commands get executed. On windows, we have a variety of shells like `cmd`, `bash`, `PowerShell, and `wsl` (windows subsystem for Linux). The recommended way on windows is to tell nodeJS to use PowerShell as its default shell which has more capabilities than the cmd shell. \\r\\n\\r\\n``` bash\\r\\n#in .npmrc\\r\\nscript-shell = \\"C:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\System32\\\\\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\\\\\v1.0\\\\\\\\powershell.exe\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n#using the CLI\\r\\nnpm config set script-shell = \\"C:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\System32\\\\\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\\\\\v1.0\\\\\\\\powershell.exe\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## About the author\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author of `cross-env` is [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) who is popular in the React community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [Github repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) is in archive mode which means no major updates are likely.

Ubuntu desktop was eccentric, esoteric, and uniquely customized to my needs. Ubuntu remains a solid OS for personal needs but not fully loaded for all my tasks. Let me show you where ubuntu-desktop shines and fades in 2021.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Why I considered Ubuntu?\\n\\nmy first encounter with ubuntu-desktop was in 2009. Back in the day, Ubuntu parent company would ship compact discs home for every minor release. That\'s so nice of them in the era where some countries were still using 2G and had scanty broadband penetration.\\n\\nIn 2021, the reasons for considering Ubuntu are the same.\\n\\n1. Ubuntu is tried and tested\\n2. Ubuntu desktop is free to use. I do not have to read and compare versions.\\n3. Ubuntu commands, package managers are familiar to me. As a web application developer.\\n\\n## Areas where Ubuntu desktop shines in 2021\\n\\nThe costs associated with the hardware and software come down substantially. In India, if I need to run windows pro, you need to shell out 12.5k INR, and to run windows you need good RAM and I recommend 16GB because we all use chrome browsers.\\n\\nUbuntu is all you need for coding, running servers, and working with NodeJS. Ubuntu suits the best for web developers who code all the time. Working with the Ubuntu terminal is a delight. It\'s such a nice responsive shell.\\n\\nNormal tasks like browsing are delightful on Ubuntu, the chrome browser from Google works great on Ubuntu without bugs. The other tools like libre office, web storm, and Typora are available on Ubuntu. I can live with Ubuntu as a developer.\\n\\nSnap package manager is a delight to use on Ubuntu.\\n\\n## Areas where Ubuntu desktop OS fades off\\n\\nThe cost savings are not substantial. As an intermediate-level developer, I took more than double the time when I am setting up some like the video editing workflow. I had no success in setting up the video editing workflow because Ubuntu and Nvidia graphic cards simply won\'t get along. If time is as precious as money, then I was losing a lot of time with Ubuntu. Boot time is quick but interaction with apps was time-consuming. Find a watermark option in LibreOffice, you will understand my pain.\\n\\n> I missed out on publishing videos on Youtube after moving to Ubuntu. It\'s a gap and it\'s compelling to fill it.\\n\\nThe apps in Ubuntu were dull and looked like built-in 2010. The GUI on most apps was simply not modernized. I understand that Ubuntu geeks love the command line but some menu items and options inappropriate places won\'t hurt. Adding to the woes is ubuntu software which is like a Microsoft store but ubuntu software hardly works.\\n\\nThe hardware of my workstation and setup won\'t work properly with Ubuntu. The dual-monitor worked great. The flatbed scanner just won\'t work out of the box and another 10 to 15 minutes setup every time I try to use it. The alternate is to use a virtual box with windows running on Ubuntu. I would scan from the virtual box OS. This move contradicts the cost savings which we anticipated.\\n\\nzoom client is not polished like its windows client. I had to settle with the browser client and there is no record on Ubuntu for zoom. This is the case with some apps where some features are missing in ubuntu.\\n\\nSecurity on Ubuntu was a deal-breaker for me. There is no reliable IT security software I can use for scanning and protecting me against threats. Some people say we do not need IT security software on Ubuntu but I differ. When you are troubleshooting some issue, you end up executing commands taken from the internet. Hardware encryption exists in Ubuntu but somehow it\'s not elegant as BitLocker in windows 10 pro.\\n\\n## Switching OS and how it feels\\n\\nIf you have not installed OS in the last 10 years like most of my friends ever since the office IT team started taking care of their laptops, then be ready for the surprise. You need tools like Rufus to burn ISO to USB in a format that\'s understandable by UEFI firmware. The first step would be to identify if your laptop is using legacy or bios or UEFI firmware.\\n\\nIt\'s not hard as it used to be. Once you install Chrome and log in, you get your life online as you used to earlier. I like that.\\n\\nOf course, I need to install some software, set up ssh, install NodeJS. The backed-up data need to be copied back. It almost takes 10 plus hours to copy the data.\\n\\n> If you remember your workflows vividly then setting up things would be easy. You would know the tools and files you would be working with.\\n\\n## Verdict\\n\\nMoving to Windows 10 frees me from remembering extra commands and keyboard shortcuts. However, there are other laptops in my home running on Ubuntu because Ubuntu is simply great for the simple use case and it justifies the costs."},{"id":"/5-questions-every-developer-should-ask-to-solidify-his-learning","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/5-questions-every-developer-should-ask-to-solidify-his-learning","source":"@site/blog/5-questions-every-developer-should-ask-to-solidify-his-learning.md","title":"5 questions every developer should ask to solidify his learning on programming languages and libraries","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-09-15T19:15:19.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"}],"readingTime":1.84,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"5 questions every developer should ask to solidify his learning on programming languages and libraries","tags":["learning"],"date":"2021-09-15T19:15:19.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Moved away from Ubuntu 21.04 to Windows 10 pro, here is why?","permalink":"/blog/Moved-away-from-Ubuntu-21-04-to-windows-10-pro-here-is-why"},"nextItem":{"title":"Build products that run till end of earth mindset, something that is missing in Indian marketplace.

Many open-source repositories go unmaintained after a few months of activity. What if every engineer takes an oath to develop products that run till the end of the earth without a major outage? What system design decisions and quality benchmarks would be needed to achieve a long shelf life of the hardware, software, services, or firmware product? Let\'s discuss it.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The declining quality in the Indian marketplace\\n\\nIndia as a country has low purchasing power parity. Having said that, the hack to push more sales is to market products at attractive prices. But attractive pricing is used as a mask to sell substandard goods and services. This mindset is going to hinder Indian products from becoming world-class. Indian techies have a tough time finding the right car because of the quality and longevity issues of the model. Adding to the problem, we never know which company will close the shop leaving customers in the cold. We need a change in a product development mindset. We need to build products that last a long time.\\n\\nFor software, lasting a long time means more extensibility, scalability, and fewer defects.\\n\\nFor hardware, lasting a long time means easy to repair, high quality, and availability of spares.\\n\\nFor firmware, lasting a long time means frequent updates, bug fixes, and no change in performance with time.\\n\\nFor services, deliver what you promise.\\n\\nLet me introduce you to an interesting ideology we followed at my first software development assignment.\\n\\n> We build software that runs till the end of the earth. Every meeting, design decision, and architecture discussion was centered around this idea of \\"Build product that would last a very long time\\".\\n\\nEven though the marketplace for that product moved away but the software was solid in terms of how it was designed to handle the problem. The solution was inspiring. I carry a decade of working experience in building software components.  Having worked with many teams and mindsets, I believe \\"Build product that would last a very long time\\" is the way we should be approaching product development.\\n\\nI cannot give you a prescription or a model to emulate, rather I can discuss a use case to emphasize building products that would last a long time for hardware, software, and firmware.\\n\\n## Designing hardware for longevity\\n\\nThe common piece of hardware that Indians are aware of would be the \\"Wall clock\\". The wall clock does one thing, that is to tell the time. To do this, the wall clock needs a power supply from the battery and a mechanical engine to move the needle at the right interval.\\n\\nWhat if the product engineer had the \\"Built to last till the end of the earth\\" requirement? The mechanical engine would be power efficient so battery life is prolonged or make it run on solar-like calculators. The clock runs with really high accuracy. The company ensures that the small watch repair shops have access to the spare parts in case the watch should run into issues like water spills or mechanical failure.\\n\\n## Designing software for longevity\\n\\nThe common piece of software that all sections of people have used or impacted would be the core banking system. It\'s also the complex software taking care of everyone\'s savings.\\n\\nFor software to work for a long time we need\\n\\n- Small isolated components which are loosely coupled, these isolated component\'s performance needs to be decided and monitored by architects. Thanks to distributed architectures, microservices, and message brokers, running apps without major outages is easier than ever before\\n\\n- Software should be extensible, nobody can predict the future. We need to keep room for extensibilities in the design plan. For example instead of fixating the UI design for 2 hyperlinks in the top navbar. What if a new requirement needs to show 3 links. It should not involve CSS changes.\\n\\n- Scalability is not everything even though it guarantees profits till the market is happy using your software. SRE to be given more emphasis. One software breach would turn the story upside down.\\n\\n- As a customer, abrupt change in data usage policies is a turnoff. I never expected when I started using the app.\\n\\n  Refer to the image at https://www.splunk.com/content/dam/splunk2/images/data-insider/what-is-site-reliability-engineering/sre-key-practices.jpg\\n\\n## Designing firmware for longevity\\n\\nWifi routers are commonly used firmware. I can use a wifi router even if it\'s slow but I need to be confident that the firmware would secure me from online threats. In the case of tech firmware, the risk of hacking decides the longevity along with performance degradation over time.\\n\\nThe unanswered question for Indian EV space would be the performance over time. How will my OLA S1 work and perform after 5 years from the date of purchase? In the case of IC-based engines, unless the quality is awful. The owner would be riding it normally after 5 years because of fewer bells and whistles attached.\\n\\n### Does the longevity of the product lead to more cost for everyone involved\\n\\nI do not agree that longevity would lead to more costs. To give you an example, any product needs a marketing budget. Let\'s say a company manufactures 10 substandard models, the cost of marketing would be high because they would never build a fan base. Instead, if the company chooses to build something like RE Bullet motorcycles (btw they carry the tag line Built like a gun) which run effortlessly even after 20 years, then the cost for producer and consumer would come down in a long run. As a thrift customer, I would not buy a new motorcycle until my current motorcycle gives up.\\n\\nThe burden on the environment is reduced. If people are not discarding their electronic goods all the time, then the resources needed to mine copper, produce and transport goods, recycle waste, etc would come down.\\n\\nIn the world of software, instead of hurrying to open source software only to maintain it for the next 2 months is not healthy. Similarly, developers and corporations should think of long term shelf life of products and how it\'s going to make money. Instead of abruptly turning off services, a piece of information is to be given to the end-user. Fabulous paid android apps were lost by me because the developer has taken the app away from the store and I had no clue that happened after changing my phone.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nDo not let your business strategy, changing market space, or predatory pricing ideas ruin the product. Be the swiss knife of quality and usability. Building products that work for a long time is a USP to be proud of. That mindset would give our country an economic edge over others."},{"id":"/Why-is-it-hard-to-hire-Angular-devs-in-India-and-what-we-can-do-about-it","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Why-is-it-hard-to-hire-Angular-devs-in-India-and-what-we-can-do-about-it","source":"@site/blog/Why-is-it-hard-to-hire-Angular-devs-in-India-and-what-we-can-do-about-it.md","title":"Why is it hard to hire Angular devs in India and what we can do about it?","description":"angular interviews","date":"2021-09-07T10:14:03.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-interviews","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-interviews"}],"readingTime":2.34,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why is it hard to hire Angular devs in India and what we can do about it?","tags":["tech-interviews"],"date":"2021-09-07T10:14:03.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Build products that run till end of earth mindset, something that is missing in Indian marketplace.

If the technology is a simple one like bootstrap, JQuery then the process is simple. But the Angular being a framework, it been a different game to be a part of the tech hiring panel\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The difference between React and Angular hiring\\n\\nGetting a high-quality React professional is easier because of the higher number of professionals working with React than Angular. The react devs looking for a job are higher than angular in 2021. I believe there is a 10:1 ratio of React to Angular developers out there.\\n\\nMost of the new projects get started with VueJS or Svelte directly leaving behind react and angular in 2021. The number of companies preferring Angular is lesser than React in 2021.\\n\\n## Hiring process\\n\\n- Starts with screening resume\\n\\n- Interview over phone\\n\\n- Coding round\\n\\n- Tech discussion\\n\\n- Finishing the hire\\n\\n- or Hacker earth route where one problem decides it all\\n\\nIn the hiring process, I get around 1.30 hours to identify the candidate\'s strengths across a variety of concepts that he/she shall be using every day.\\n\\n## Why angular devs score low in interviews\\n\\nThe basic expectation is that the developer has a good understanding of Javascript because they work with the frontend. But it\'s not the case with Angular developers because they work with Typescript. It\'s very rare for Angular developers to have a good understanding of Javascript concepts.\\n\\nLet\'s start with typescript. In the coding round, I check for the `types`  concept in typescript. If the candidate uses `any` in place of `union of types` then he gets a `zero` in typescript skills. This candidate has a bigger challenge to prove himself in the other parts of the interview.\\n\\nLet\'s move on to components in Angular. It\'s a simple concept but the component design thinking is better in react devs than in Angular. In Angular, there are too many concepts where developers have awareness but lack mastery is my concern. Thanks to video courses, a lot of interview candidates walk into the interview with no real-world experience or in-depth understanding.\\n\\nThe deal breaker is unit testing. In the real world, business applications are backed with unit test cases. The Angular comes with the unit, integration tests. It\'s again difficult to see developers using either of them. At least a theoretical understanding will give them an edge but they lack it.\\n\\n## What can be done about it\\n\\nHave a strong core team who can mentor react/JS developers to quickly learn and work with Angular. It\'s really hard to go scouting for a qualified Angular developer. This way we can hire talented folks and cut the cost associated with hiring activity."},{"id":"/Lessons-from-my-18-months-of-WFH-checklist","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Lessons-from-my-18-months-of-WFH-checklist","source":"@site/blog/Lessons-from-my-18-months-of-WFH-checklist.md","title":"Lessons from my 18 months of WFH, checklist","description":"18-months-wfh","date":"2021-09-03T07:25:04.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"essays","permalink":"/blog/tags/essays"}],"readingTime":4.17,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Lessons from my 18 months of WFH, checklist","tags":["essays"],"date":"2021-09-03T07:25:04.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why is it hard to hire Angular devs in India and what we can do about it?","permalink":"/blog/Why-is-it-hard-to-hire-Angular-devs-in-India-and-what-we-can-do-about-it"},"nextItem":{"title":"Automating npm packages updates with renovate bot on github","permalink":"/blog/Automating-npm-packages-updates-with-renovate-on-github"}},"content":"![18-months-wfh](./assets/18months-wfh.webp)\\n\\n\\nBack in 2015, I was reading the book **Remote, office not required by Basecamp** and it felt like a distant dream to work from home (WFH) even though I worked in the tech industry as an independent contributor. Due to the pandemic, almost overnight the IT employees became accidental WFH professionals. It was a good choice because the infrastructure inside and outside the office was built around the concept of **Social distancing**.

Going through a checklist every day like an **Airline pilot** boosts my productivity.\\n\\n## Areas where my WFH setup can improve\\n\\nThere are very few actually\\n\\n1. The room is shared with a family member and noise from the bathroom can be disturbing. Eavesdropping and checking with me about some low priority things cannot be removed completely.\\n\\n2. The work can be monotonous which makes me slack, I need to identify and come out of the slump\\n\\n3. Ergonomics is still far from perfect. I have experimented with\\n    1. Standing and working - productivity at the minimum, not suitable for deep work unless you are monitoring the work.\\n   \\n    2. Sitting in an office chair - you need to move around frequently and legs can become cold because we do not wear shoes inside homes in India. Ideal for deep work.\\n   \\n    3. Sit on the floor and laptop on your lap - works well for 3 hours, after that, I need to do stretches. Optimal productivity but less than sitting in the office chair.\\n   \\n4. Lunch breaks can get longer when someone pulls you into a family discussion\\n\\n## Has your performance increased or is it the same in WFH condition\\n\\n**Project execution** is a major thing in software projects. I was fortunate to work under good project managers. Project execution can make a team behave like lions or like dogs.\\n\\nMy team has delivered all the major deliverables on time with better quality.\\n\\nMy performance is the same I used to carry a home lot of work because of long commutes and lengthy face-to-face meetings. Now I do not have that carry home and work issue, the work is there in the next room.\\n\\nThe number of meetings has come down, team members know whom to get into a meeting with. So only a few people get pulled into a meeting. If not interested, you can click the left button instead of having to walk out of the room which is considered rude in our culture.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n- Run through your WFH checklist before starting work\\n\\n- Fix the WFH setup issues like the way you fix the plumbing issue\\n\\n- Like **Peter Drucker** pointed out, self-feedback on WFH is an absolute must to navigate your career."},{"id":"/Automating-npm-packages-updates-with-renovate-on-github","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Automating-npm-packages-updates-with-renovate-on-github","source":"@site/blog/Automating-npm-packages-updates-with-renovate-on-github.md","title":"Automating npm packages updates with renovate bot on github","description":"react renovate","date":"2021-08-07T15:57:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Automation","permalink":"/blog/tags/automation"}],"readingTime":4.51,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Automating npm packages updates with renovate bot on github","tags":["Automation"],"date":"2021-08-07T15:57:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Lessons from my 18 months of WFH, checklist","permalink":"/blog/Lessons-from-my-18-months-of-WFH-checklist"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building and distributing lightweight NPM packages for react projects","permalink":"/blog/Building-and-distributing-light-weight-NPM-packages-for-react-projects"}},"content":"![react renovate](./assets/react-renovate-update-pr.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this how to article, I will be discussing how we can set up a GitHub application to automatically keep our npm packages updated without breaking the app. We will also discuss the shortcomings of this application and if it\'s the right fit for use in production or in a team environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n \\r\\n## What is the problem which we are trying to solve?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us start with `semantic versioning` of the npm packages. We have 3 segments in the version number which looks like 17.0.2 (which is the react version at the time of writing this blog post).\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Major version\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Minor version\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Patch version\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking the above version 17.0.2 as an example, we have 17 as major, 0 as minor, and 2 as patch version. Let us say react team releases the next major version, then some APIs might be at risk of not working or deprecated. so the developer reads the changelog and chooses between upgrading or continuing with the same version.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Problem #1\\r\\n> In most teams, the npm packages are not updated regularly which puts the application at security risk, and also the team is missing out on the recent developments in the frameworks like bug fixes and performance improvement. This is a type of tech debt that the team needs to pay from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis problem can be automated. There is a GitHub application for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other concepts called version drift which is solved by `package-lock.json` which you may read about elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Problem #2\\r\\n\\r\\n> By default npm will use symbol `^` before the semver version which means that the latest minor change above this semver version will be installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue is that we cannot be sure which version has been installed unless we dig through package-lock.json which the developer has to upload along with the package.json file.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Renovate for Automating version updates\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tool/app which solves the problem of npm package updates is called `Renovate` which is backed by a company called white source.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tool renovate comes in different flavors\\r\\n\\r\\n- As an npm package called [renovate on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/renovate)\\r\\n\\r\\n- As a [github application](https://github.com/apps/renovate) and as an app on similar git platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\n- As an on-premise solution which I have not evaluated\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to renovate works as a GitHub app\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to follow few steps, and you will be ready to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. We assume you have a repo on GitHub which is old enough and needs npm package updates. I had the react-redux production-ready boilerplate project which is at least 6 months old.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Goto renovate app and select the repo to which renovate will have access. you can give access to all the repositories but I do not see any point given the fact that some of them are forks of other projects which I do not intend to maintain.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. You will receive a welcome PR from renovating with the config file that will be added to your codebase. Merging this PR means you agree to renovate the app to work with your repo. `renovate.json` file will be added to the codebase after this step.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. After this step, you will start receiving a bunch of PRs to your repo from `renovate`. Most of the PRs are about pinning the semver version to a specific number and avoid the symbol `^`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![renovate PRs github](./assets/renovate-PRS.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n5. You can accept or decline the PR. Declining the PR means renovate will no longer work on updating or notifying about the npm package in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![renovate changelog](./assets/renovate-changelog.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n6. I also got a PR to fix my node-engine version.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. You can configure renovate to send you PRs on a specific day and of course, a lot of customization can be done with their configuration changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. You can use their npm global package to validate the configuration file for errors. It\'s called the `renovate-config-validator` command after you install `renovate` globally.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Advantages of renovate\\r\\n\\r\\nI have written about dependabot previously. Dependabot takes care of vulnerability fixes to the npm packages. Renovate does something similar to the \\r\\nnpm packages by keeping them updated in `real time` for free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe configuration was straightforward forward and I found the bot to be predictable. The npm-based command to validate renovate config file was great. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe same bot can be used for updated other platform tools like PHP compose, python-pip packages. The bot had been updated by the GitHub actions version too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![renovate actions update](./assets/renovate-actions.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Shortcomings\\r\\n\\r\\nThe configurations were not easy to understand at a glance. To check if the config works we need to wait for some package to be updated and we will get a PR with the new configuration applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not sure how to configure on my local or CI after going through their docs. Felt like the docs were rushed (like my blog lol).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no explanation/justification about the below PR and why it\'s happening. The logs did not help me understand why this is important.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![react renovate node engine](./assets/node-engine.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Verdict\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall an easy-to-use bot to keep your npm packages updated. Suitable for GitHub and non-GitHub repositories. Fits the most popular programming lang packages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![react changelog renovate](./assets/changelog-renovate-pr.webp)"},{"id":"/Building-and-distributing-light-weight-NPM-packages-for-react-projects","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Building-and-distributing-light-weight-NPM-packages-for-react-projects","source":"@site/blog/Building-and-distributing-light-weight-NPM-packages-for-react-projects.md","title":"Building and distributing lightweight NPM packages for react projects","description":"dependencies in package json","date":"2021-06-11T22:19:48.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":3.18,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building and distributing lightweight NPM packages for react projects","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2021-06-11T22:19:48.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Automating npm packages updates with renovate bot on github","permalink":"/blog/Automating-npm-packages-updates-with-renovate-on-github"},"nextItem":{"title":"Javascript collections implementation in ES6, heard of weakmap?","permalink":"/blog/Javascript-collections-implementation-in-ES6-heard-of-weakmap"}},"content":"![dependencies in package json](./assets/peer-dependencies-npm-package.webp)\\n\\nIf your NPM package is composed of self Javascript code, then code rewrite or optimization is the way to go. If your npm package is composed of other JS libs which would also be a dependency of the host application, then we have some good news. Have you thought of using peer dependencies?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Got a package on your mind, want to know its weight?\\n\\nTry the online tool called bundlophobia. https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-virtualized@9.22.3\\n\\n## Back to lightweight react npm packages\\n\\nBefore we start building sleek npm packages, let\'s talk about what contributes to bundle size weight? The answer is the composition of the bundle. A bundle can have something like the moment-time-zone package to achieve something that can be done is 3 lines of JS code. A bundle can be composed of lodash package because we had imported it incorrectly and the tree shaking could not help you.\\n\\n> The answer to sleek JS bundle is to keep a check on the npm packages that we are imported for use in our code.\\n\\nThe same goes with npm packages, the size is dependent on the composition. Let\'s take the example of https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-virtualized@9.22.3 . The react-virtualized package is composed of react virtualized code, babel runtime, prop types, dom helpers, etc. If you look at the package.json on their GitHub page at https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/abe0530a512639c042e74009fbf647abdb52d661/package.json \\n\\nThe react-virtualized package could have added few more kiloBytes if the author had decided to put react and react-dom in dependencies, instead the author had put their reference under peer-dependencies. \\n\\n```json\\n\\"peerDependencies\\": {\\n    \\"react\\": \\"^15.3.0 || ^16.0.0-alpha || ^17.0.1\\",\\n    \\"react-dom\\": \\"^15.3.0 || ^16.0.0-alpha || ^17.0.1\\"\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nBefore we talk about peer dependencies, let\'s recap the types of dependencies an npm package can have. Some of these dependencies are added to the npm package bundle size.\\n\\n1. dependencies: when one of the packages under dependencies is missing or not found, the package will not work. Npm install will throw an error.\\n\\n2. dev-dependencies: during development, a developer might need a transpiler like babel, a bundler, etc. These are not needed in production so the packages used in development are put under dev-dependencies\\n\\n3. optional-dependencies: sometimes we may code to import a package optionally. By optionally, I mean when package A is not, use the fallback package A1. The npm install won\'t throw an error if package A was not found.\\n\\n4. peer-dependencies: when our npm package is a plugin that works on top of some other library, then we can put that library under peer-dependencies.\\n\\n5. peerDependenciesMeta: similar to peer-dependencies but NPM won\'t throw a warning when the package is not found in the host. The packages under peer-dependencies-meta are optional. This can further reduce the size of your bundle. For instance, the same package can be used for browser and server environments.\\n\\n> peer-dependencies are similar to dependencies but they are expected to be provided by the host application. peer-dependencies is a common pattern when developing react plugins.\\n\\nThe npm packages for react projects mostly use react & react-dom as a dependency. The dependencies of the npm package go into the package bundle. To avoid the double copy of react. We can use peer dependencies. This can help prevent duplicate code from going into the final bundle of your react application.\\n\\nTo analyze your react bundles, I recommend the webpack bundle analyzer plugin on your production build.\\n\\nTo sum it up, for react related npm packages. Kindly use peer-dependencies and peer-dependencies-meta to control the bundle size.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"peerDependencies\\": {\\n    \\"react\\": \\"^16.8.3 || ^17\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"peerDependenciesMeta\\": {\\n    \\"react-dom\\": {\\n      \\"optional\\": true\\n    },\\n```\\n\\nThe above JSON is taken from the react-redux package.json file."},{"id":"/Javascript-collections-implementation-in-ES6-heard-of-weakmap","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Javascript-collections-implementation-in-ES6-heard-of-weakmap","source":"@site/blog/Javascript-collections-implementation-in-ES6-heard-of-weakmap.md","title":"Javascript collections implementation in ES6, heard of weakmap?","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-06-11T00:46:34.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.77,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Javascript collections implementation in ES6, heard of weakmap?","categories":["frontend"],"date":"2021-06-11T00:46:34.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Building and distributing lightweight NPM packages for react projects","permalink":"/blog/Building-and-distributing-light-weight-NPM-packages-for-react-projects"},"nextItem":{"title":"HTTP methods, timeout & ajax response types in Javascript discussed","permalink":"/blog/HTTP-methods-ajax-response-types-in-Javascript-discussed"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/garbage-collection.webp)\\n\\nTo implement a data structure in Javascript, we used Array or Object but things are set to change.

Read more about the difference between Object and Map here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map#objects_vs._maps\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar phoneBook = new Map();\\nphoneBook.set(100, 100);\\nphoneBook.set(\'JS-HQ\' ,1001);\\n\\n// Map is iterable but Objects are not\\n// Map can be cloned, merged\\n\\nphoneBook.size; // 2\\n```\\n\\n## Set\\n\\nSet is similar to an array but the items of the set must be unique.\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar array = [1,2,3,1];\\nvar set = new Set(array);\\nconsole.log(set); // {1, 2, 3} \\n```\\n\\n## Weak as in easily garbage collected\\n\\nThe last 2 new entrants are \\n\\n1. WeakMap\\n\\n2. WeakSet\\n\\nWe need to understand javascript garbage collection. An object is garbage collected when\\n\\n1. The object is deallocated by setting to null\\n\\n2. The object is no longer referenced\\n\\n3. No keys, values, or entries of the Object exists. The entries in Map and Set count as references and the object is no longer garbage collected.\\n\\nIn the case of weakmap and weakset, the object references are held weakly. \\n\\nIn case of weakMap & weakSet, the objects are dereferenced when all other references are removed. Use these data structures when you are interested in better memory management.\\n\\nIn a weak map, a key is always an object.\\n\\n> The WeakMap is great for memos because once the object (used as the key) gets garbage collected, so does the computed value on the WeakMap."},{"id":"/HTTP-methods-ajax-response-types-in-Javascript-discussed","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/HTTP-methods-ajax-response-types-in-Javascript-discussed","source":"@site/blog/HTTP-methods-ajax-response-types-in-Javascript-discussed.md","title":"HTTP methods, timeout & ajax response types in Javascript discussed","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-06-10T23:59:13.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":1.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"HTTP methods, timeout & ajax response types in Javascript discussed","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2021-06-10T23:59:13.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Javascript collections implementation in ES6, heard of weakmap?","permalink":"/blog/Javascript-collections-implementation-in-ES6-heard-of-weakmap"},"nextItem":{"title":"How do the JS stack and the queue factor into event handling?","permalink":"/blog/How-do-the-stack-and-the-queue-factor-into-event-handling"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/async-service.webp)\\n\\nGET and POST are the two commonly used HTTP methods.

Let us discuss the question further.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## How do the Javascript stack and the queue factor into event handling?\\n\\n> alias -  What is event loop in JS\\n\\nJS is single threaded. The Javascript thread works with other thread in a concurrency model based on event loop. Event loop is responsible for executing async code & handling events.\\n\\n> The event loop takes care of scheduling part of asynchronous code execution for JS Engines. The event loop exists irrespective of JS engine running on browser or server.\\n\\n1. When a user action occurs on a webpage, the `event tracking` thread checks for the associated event handler for the event.\\n   \\n2. If event handler is found, the event loop pushes the eventhandler to the JS queue so that the handler gets executed when the stack is free.\\n   \\n3. If no event handler is found, then nothing happens.\\n   \\n4. the event loop puts the event handler to the queue to execute at the earliest, but the event loop does not interrupt the current running items in the stack.\\n\\nWhen an async code is executed, the event loop puts it on the queue. The async code gets executed once the stack is empty.\\n\\nKeywords: event handling, async, stack, queue, JS thread\\n\\n\\n## How do you stop the event from bubbling up the DOM tree?\\n\\nuse `event.stopPropogation` method. This helps us with which element can handle the event and which one should not be interested in the event.\\n\\n## How to avoid default actions from the browser?\\n\\nCertain functionalities or actions are added by default by the browser like\\n\\n1. the last button in the form acting as a submit button\\n   \\n2. the anchor tag click taking us to next page after bubling and capture phase\\n   \\n3. the tooltip of the image is the alt text\\n\\nThese events cannot be stopped with event.stopPropogation even if they occur after bubbling phase. so we have event.preventDefault. We can stop any default action added by browser. This helps us write better consistent apps.\\n\\n## What do you know about non mouse event bindings\\n\\nThis is a topic related to accessibility context. We must write events that help people who have trouble using mouse or visually impaired. Here are some techniques.\\n\\n1. Use enter key based event along with click event\\n\\n2. Use focus and blur events when mouse over, mouse out are used."},{"id":"/Why-are-HTML-files-parsed-and-not-just-read-in-the-browser","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Why-are-HTML-files-parsed-and-not-just-read-in-the-browser","source":"@site/blog/Why-are-HTML-files-parsed-and-not-just-read-in-the-browser.md","title":"Why are HTML files parsed and not just read in the browser?","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-06-09T22:43:27.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-interviews","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-interviews"}],"readingTime":1.1,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why are HTML files parsed and not just read in the browser?","tags":["tech-interviews"],"date":"2021-06-09T22:43:27.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How do the JS stack and the queue factor into event handling?","permalink":"/blog/How-do-the-stack-and-the-queue-factor-into-event-handling"},"nextItem":{"title":"Fitts law and CTA, how are they related in the context of UI design?","permalink":"/blog/Fitts-law-and-CTA-how-are-they-related"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/white-board-discussion.webp)\\n\\nWhy are HTML files parsed and not just read in the browser?

The design of the website can help the business owner achieve their CTA.

As a kid, I used to play the game Cricket. I was an average bowler. Bowling means you have to aim at the target, which is the stumps, and throw the ball correctly at them.\\n\\nWhen the distance between the bowler and stumps increases (which happens because it\'s not the standard form of cricket), the chances of hitting the stumps are reduced. Mathematically there is a relation between the distance, target, and the ability of the bowler to achieve his goal. That\'s exactly what Fitts law is about.\\n\\nLet\'s revisit Fitts law,\\n\\n> Fitts\u2019 Law states that the bigger an object is and the closer it is to us, the easier it will be for us to reach it.\\n\\n## Fitts law and the web CTA (Call To Action)\\n\\nLet\'s relate the Fitts law to the elements on the web.\\n\\nWe have buttons on the web which enable the user to take action. Like the \\"Add to Cart\\", \\"Checkout\\" & \\"Make Payment\\" buttons.\\n\\nLet\'s talk about the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. \\n\\n- The add-to-cart should be near the product description.\\n\\n- The add-to-cart should be big enough for the user to aim or point his mouse at the button.\\n\\nWhen the distance of the \\"Add to Cart\\" is close to the subject and the size of the CTA button is big, then according to Fitts law we can better conversions.\\n\\n## The real-world examples of Fitts law\\n\\n- Offline shopping and design of the physical stores.\\n\\n\\n![offline shopping and its relation to Fitts law](./assets/offline-shopping.webp)\\n\\n\\n- Computer screens, the important buttons are always bigger like the CTA buttons on the PDP page.\\n\\n- Signboards near the flyover. The distance between your eyes and the target is reduced so there are greater chances that the ad gets viewed.\\n\\n- Games like cricket. Given a shorter distance between the fielder and the stumps, the fielder has greater chances of making successful run-outs. That\'s one reason, the fielders in the inner circle are aggressive to make a runout.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThere are 3 key elements to Fitts law\\n\\n- Target \\n- Distance\\n- Width or size\\n\\nOn the web the\\n\\n- Target is the CTA button\\n- Distance is the button position/location on the UI.\\n- Size of the button to make the button stand out.\\n\\nThe designer should remember Fitts law and make better UI designs. For instance\\n\\n- Floating add to cart buttons on the PDP page, so that the button is always visible.\\n- Complete payment button near the card information fields instead of bottom right or top right.\\n- When the target is to complete the user journey through checkout flow, the designer has to ensure the distance or user flow is not too long.\\n\\n> I recently visited a wizard where I was on step 1 out of 35.

If the audience were students, a white background and times new roman text with a font size of 16px will be used. If the audience were in higher management, fancy colors with photos will be used.\\n\\nThe users using the PowerPoint software loved it so much that even today, people prefer PowerPoint instead of any other web app where you can make presentations.\\n\\n## What\'s the reason for the amazing UX on PowerPoint\\n\\nIt boils down to core elements like\\n\\n### Capability of the app to use native APIs\\n\\nOn the web, we are expanding our boundaries with web API like geolocation, SMS, etc but we are still yet to get there. The native apps can directly read from hard disk, accessing and storing content.\\n\\n### Reliable behavior of the app\\n\\nWhether we had an internet connection or not, a PowerPoint saved on the hard disk would open reliably on the PowerPoint. The performance of the PowerPoint software was quite predictable. Even if the app crashes or the system restarts, the app would save and restore a copy for the user to continue his work.\\n\\n### Instability and integration with the native OS\\n\\nWhen we install an app like PowerPoint we get \\n\\n- the app listed in the start menu\\n\\n- any file with a PowerPoint extension will be opened on PowerPoint by default\\n\\n- The PowerPoint will be deeply integrated with the explorer and when not needed the PowerPoint app will be uninstalled.\\n\\nTo sum it up, the desktop apps are \\n\\n- capable and fast\\n\\n- reliable without internet connection\\n\\n- Engaging with users and other apps on the native OS\\n\\n## Features on PWA\\n\\nPWAs are trying to be like desktop apps. For instance, the PWAs run in their window. The apps can be installed and uninstalled like native apps.

Follow a checklist.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n> Approach the PR review with the checklist instead of rubber-stamping or filling it with comments which pull down team morale.\\n\\n## Checklist for PR review \\n\\n1. Developer self verifies his PR for syntax, log statements, unit test updations,  style guide deviations, etc\\n\\n2. Senior dev checks if the components are used correctly in the blank, ideal and overloaded state. The basic sanity test is done at localhost to identify behavioral issues.\\n\\n3. QA team members do a remote sharing or loads branch on his vagrant to do manual verification against a user story. The QA also tests the app under varying configurations. The business logic is also tested.\\n\\n4. The CI process runs ensuring the app runs as expected without regression issues.\\n\\n5. The code gets merged to the trunk after which a bumped daily build gets generated. Developer/QA verifies if functionality works well in a different environment.\\n\\n## Why makes checklists hard to use while PR reviews\\n\\nIt\'s hard because, in real teams, many things go wrong\\n\\n- devs do not have a style guide or established pattern to follow so self-verification becomes hard. each dev on the team does things his way.\\n\\n- the reviewers are loaded with work so they resort to rubber stamping\\n  \\n- the existing tech debt is too much to make any good judgment or suggestion\\n\\n- some unrelated QA is engaged only after daily build.\\n  \\n## Why should manual testing happen before PR gets merged. \\n  \\nI recommend the QA step because most teams have trust in CI which runs unit and automation tests before the merge, why not manual testing too so we are generating builds with better quality? Defects logged at this stage can be rectified before the merge. This QA step is important if you are shipping frontend-related work on tight schedules.\\n\\n## Discussions, comments, and complaints during PR reviews\\n\\n> Discussions during PR is a friendly way to learn, mentor other developers. Discussions to be held by code owners.\\n\\nI prefer a screen-sharing discussion if it\'s a short PR with minor changes. When there are multiple issues, then commenting on the code is unavoidable.\\n\\nTry and avoid lengthy PRs containing both frontend and backend especially if you have separate SMEs for frontend and backend. Cross-track dependency will increase the PR review time.\\n\\n> Comments can be a valuable thing when used sparingly. Other team members will join the discussion to correct things or share their thoughts.\\n\\nI comment when I want other team members\' opinions about the new code. For instance, I post a comment about a condition used incorrectly. If I were wrong, someone on the team can correct me.\\n\\n> Complaints are exchanged when the developer disrespects or acts sneakily around the comments. Of course, not everyone is equally passionate about the same subject/topic\\n\\n so they tend to ignore few things. That could lead to frustration and complaints. Make sure you request such developers to put shorter PRs so that it\'s easy to guide them. \\n\\n> Troublesome developers and many PR comments do not go well. They simply invite more complaints.\\n\\nA successful PR is a combination of a checklist and a personalized approach."},{"id":"/Snap-package-manager-in-ubuntu-discussed","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Snap-package-manager-in-ubuntu-discussed","source":"@site/blog/Snap-package-manager-in-ubuntu-discussed.md","title":"Snap package manager in ubuntu discussed","description":"lady-installing-snap-ubuntu","date":"2021-04-20T23:28:38.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"software-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-tools"}],"readingTime":2.97,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Snap package manager in ubuntu discussed","tags":["software-tools"],"date":"2021-04-20T23:28:38.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How do you ensure that the software you develop has less defects?","permalink":"/blog/Do-the-PR-review-the-harder-way-to-reduce-defects"},"nextItem":{"title":"Changing my personal PC operating system to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & my desk setup","permalink":"/blog/Changing-my-personal-PC-operating-system-to-Ubuntu-20-04-LTS"}},"content":"![lady-installing-snap-ubuntu](./assets/lady-installing-snap-ubuntu.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nUbuntu software center, Apt, and multiple others ways to install the software in Ubuntu but what is this snap. Looks like it\'s the new cool. Let\'s find out more about snap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to keep this article short because Wikipedia has discussed at length about snap.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why snap?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you develop applications, we want to keep the application in such a way it\'s easy to distribute. In Ubuntu, the applications were built in .deb format which means the apps are packaged in the format which is tied to the distro. For instance, we cannot instance .deb in fedora.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a snap, the software is packaged in such a way the distro dependencies are eliminated. The same snap packages can be installed on different distros by the developer.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Looks like it\'s a win-win, is there any catch?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the developers have more power to distribute the apps easily on all distros which means a few good and bad things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good parts are \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Easy to distribute and spread your app\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Monetization is easier because you have a wider audience and your app is not tied to a cross-section of Linux users.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Bugs could be reduced as platform dependencies are reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bad parts are \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Easy to spread bad apps, malware, miners, etc\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The developer needs to keep things up to date. The distro team has no interference or responsibility to check the package. However, a bot will check the snap for malware, etc but I do not think its fool a proof strategy against attacks that could come through snaps\\r\\n\\r\\n## The difference between snaps and apt packages is not clear yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Snaps are distributed from snap stores but apt packages are distributed from official repositories maintained by the distro team\\r\\n\\r\\n- Distro team has no say on what app can go into the snap store and which can be installed on the distro later\\r\\n\\r\\n- Building an app in snap format is less complex compared to other traditional packaging systems. The tool kit involved in developer workflow is different however the archives, package management concepts remain the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n- snaps carry their dependencies making the apps bulkier but apt packages have shared dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n- snaps are automatically updated but apt packages are manually updated\\r\\n\\r\\n- In the case of both apt and snap, the discretion of the user to choose the developer is required. Some fraud developer can trick the systems\\r\\n\\r\\n## Are most popular apps already in the snap format\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, they are in snap format. For instance, the IDE which I am using (Webstorm) is provided by Jetbrains themselves on [snap store website](https://snapcraft.io/). I am convinced about snap packaging and if I ever launch an app on Ubuntu it would be a snap app. Btw I see some nice shiny apps in the snap store including shareware and trialware.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo know if an app is a snap, do run the command\\r\\n\\r\\n```shell\\r\\nwhereis webstorm\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see all the snaps\\r\\n\\r\\n```shell\\r\\nsnap list\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo install a snap\\r\\n\\r\\n```shell\\r\\nsudo snap install packageName\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo uninstall a snap\\r\\n\\r\\n```shell\\r\\nsudo snap remove packageName\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think you need a command to update snaps, the snap packages are auto-updated. \\r\\n\\r\\n```shell\\r\\nsnap refresh\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFind out more information like build number of app using\\r\\n\\r\\n```shell\\r\\nsnap info packageName\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also disable and enable snaps like mobile apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n## One thing to remember\\r\\n\\r\\n> Snap is both a command-line interface and an application package format, snaps can be found on snap store\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://snapcraft.io/docs/"},{"id":"/Changing-my-personal-PC-operating-system-to-Ubuntu-20-04-LTS","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Changing-my-personal-PC-operating-system-to-Ubuntu-20-04-LTS","source":"@site/blog/Changing-my-personal-PC-operating-system-to-Ubuntu-20-04-LTS.md","title":"Changing my personal PC operating system to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & my desk setup","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-04-18T22:21:30.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"software-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-tools"}],"readingTime":7.24,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Changing my personal PC operating system to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & my desk setup","tags":["software-tools"],"date":"2021-04-18T22:21:30.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Snap package manager in ubuntu discussed","permalink":"/blog/Snap-package-manager-in-ubuntu-discussed"},"nextItem":{"title":"Syllabus for senior frontend dev in 2021","permalink":"/blog/Syllabus-for-modern-senior-frontend-dev-2021"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/not-my-desk.webp)\\n\\nThe above picture is not my desk. It could be my future desk. Let\'s get back to reality. Bad things do happen like PC Operating systems getting cluttered, developing lags, and finally frequent blue screen of death on windows pro on my laptop. It was not an easy decision to move to ubuntu but there is no other way out. Here is why\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Tell us a little bit about your PC and Ubuntu connection?\\n\\nI had always been a ubuntu fanboy since 2009. Those were days Ubuntu backer canonical was shipping free CD distro to home free of cost. In 2009 my PC setup was different. I had an assembled desktop that was running Windows XP. I was not sure if it were genuine XP OS or not because it was an assembled PC and as a student, the IT spends have to be low. The XP OS started crashing frequently and I was forced to consider giving ubuntu CDs a try. The timing was right, the broadband penetration at Indian towns made Ubuntu adoption easy. Back then DVD full of software was the norm to distribute software for home PCs. With an ubuntu and 256Kbps broadband connection, I was able to explore new horizons. I was amazed at the simplicity and stability of Ubuntu OS since 9.04. For college projects, I managed with virtual box and windows XP. The setup worked well for at least 5 years.\\n\\nThen the desktop developed hardware issues and I got it replaced with the preowned laptop on which I am writing this blog. The laptop was once a rockstar in 2015 but in 2021 it\'s old and got battered with windows 10 pro updates which are quite frequent and bulky these days.\\n\\nThe extra graphic card was the reason why I moved from Ubuntu to Windows 10. I hardly made use of the graphic card, I never played a game on my laptop. The confusion with the scrapping of the virtual box and features like BitLocker made me consider upgrading to windows 10 pro for an extra 10000 INR a few years ago. I used BitLocker all the time but none of the other windows 10 pro features.\\n\\nNow the frequent blue screen of death followed by 15 minute boot time made me leave windows 10 pro. I flashed windows 10 once thinking the OS was cluttered but after installing basics like antivirus, OS updates, etc the laptop would become too slow. I think the laptop cannot handle the edge anymore, pun intended.\\n\\n## What was your checklist before installing Ubuntu on your Windows 10 laptop?\\n\\nLuckily I had the luxury to backup all my data well in time. I use folders with year and month names like `2021.04`, `2020.11` etc to backup my frequently changed folders like documents, etc. The less frequently changed folders like video content are put in a different folder called `cold-line` (a term taken from data storage). The backup of data is the first step before leaving the old OS with data.\\n\\n1. Backup data on the external hard disk\\n\\n2. Check if you have backed up password files, ssh, etc\\n\\n3. Download ISO and flash the ISO to USB.\\n\\n4. Do a USB boot\\n\\nmisc\\n\\n1. Check if your peripherals are going to work fine like scanners, etc\\n\\n2. Decide on absolute minimum software installs on day one. You do not have to install that fancy video editing software etc\\n\\n## Was installing an ubuntu glitch-free?\\n\\nNot at all, I did the same mistake which many rookies do. Install every damn software apps that I would use. I wasted the whole weekend only to run into an issue with the Nvidia driver which made me flash the hard disk with a fresh install of Ubuntu.\\n\\nThat was a bummer, now I learned a valuable lesson.\\n\\n> Install the software on a demand basis, do not install everything at once without restarting your machine in between.\\n\\nThe UEFI firmware has so many settings like confusing app servers. Should I enable secure boot or not? I do not understand how secure boot works yet.\\n\\nI am an antivirus freak, I did not find any reliable antivirus for Ubuntu yet like my Kaspersky total security on windows 10 pro.\\n\\n## Did all your peripherals work fine?\\n\\nCanon flatbed scanner did not work as expected. The apps which I use for scanning look too outdated in terms of richness of features. But I am going to leave it for now until I need all the finer settings.\\n\\n## Did you copy all the 1.5TB data back to the hard disk?\\n\\nNo, It\'s like a dump of data including ebooks, audiobooks, video content, photos, etc. I know on which external hard disk it sits so I will copy whenever required. As an IT professional, most of my content is on Gmail & GitHub.\\n\\n## What happened to your IT spend after you installed ubuntu\\n\\nThe costs should technically come down but I am not concerned about costs at this point. I paid for BitDefender security and it gave me peace of mind that my hard disk content cannot be read. With ubuntu, I know it\'s secure but I am also afraid of the lack of encryption.\\n\\nThe same with antivirus, I had already spent on a yearly subscription for antivirus, office products and I had to abandon them. I have no plans of installing wine on Ubuntu.\\n\\n## What were any good moments that you found after moving to Ubuntu\\n\\nThere were quite a good number of improvements like the https://snapcraft.io/ which gave commands for the most frequently used apps.\\n\\n1. The chrome made most of the sync easy. Just login to your Gmail and your world is back including saved bookmarks and passwords. \\n\\n2. The web store app which is my IDE is also available on Linux which made things easy. The settings repo did not work as expected so I had to do some extra configurations.\\n\\n3. The other apps like VS Code, Calibre, etc are also available on Ubuntu making it a lot easier to continue working.\\n\\n## Whats your must-have software that you have installed on day one\\n\\n1. Git\\n\\n2. NodeJS\\n\\n3. Discord chat\\n\\n4. Keepass\\n\\n5. 7Zip\\n\\n6. Calibre\\n\\n7. Webstorm, VS Code\\n\\n8. Chrome\\n\\n& OS updates\\n\\nI did not try installing Nvidia drivers because I won\'t be using them anyway.\\n\\n## How is the laptop performing after moving away from windows 10 pro?\\n\\nI am tempted to run the `top` command to pull in the stats but let me use the system monitor for now. The CPU utilization is fairly low. The keys are responsive. I can see the output immediately. \\n\\nNpm installs and other node-related things are quite fast which is making me happy.\\n\\nThe boot time is still unpredictable, but it\'s on an average of one and half a minute. In windows 10 times it was nearly 15 minutes till everything got responsive to use.\\n\\n## As your laptop is old, what expenses did you run into?\\n\\nMy laptop had decent insurance cover but most IT repairs occurred after the insurance got expired.\\n\\n- The keyboard had to be changed because some keys were not working. The new keyboard is not a genuine part so it kind of ruined the premium look of the laptop\\n\\n- The laptop on/off button developed an issue due to which the laptop won\'t start at all. After repairs, the button kind of works but the haptic/button feel does not sound right\\n\\n- The laptop charger and battery were both replaced.\\n\\n- I am planning to replace the hard disk with SSD in near future.\\n  \\n## What is your desk setup like\\n\\nIt\'s jugaad actually. Nothing purchased with a plan or at once.\\n\\n- The desk is around 12 years old and has several cosmetic repairs\\n  \\n- The office chair is unused and a plastic chair is used in its place. \\n  \\n- The most used peripherals includes Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard\\n  \\n- I am equally proud of the tiltable in all directions HP 22 inch extra monitor. I set it to portrait when reading lofty documentation.\\n\\n- There is a flatbed scanner used sparingly. Its USB powered which reduces the demand for a socket\\n\\n- There is a fitness band hidden somewhere in the chaos on the desk. I need to find it out.\\n\\n- The Alexa takes care of automatically turning on and off the light. Sometimes used for light music on Friday evening.\\n\\n- There is a vehicle refrigerator used as a water chiller near the workplace.\\n\\n- A 10-inch tab which becomes my permanent tech ebooks reading device\\n\\n> All the laptops in my home run Ubuntu OS excluding the office laptop."},{"id":"/Syllabus-for-modern-senior-frontend-dev-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Syllabus-for-modern-senior-frontend-dev-2021","source":"@site/blog/Syllabus-for-modern-senior-frontend-dev-2021.md","title":"Syllabus for senior frontend dev in 2021","description":"syllabus-for-frontend-devs","date":"2021-03-19T09:56:58.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-interviews","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-interviews"}],"readingTime":3.74,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Syllabus for senior frontend dev in 2021","tags":["tech-interviews"],"date":"2021-03-19T09:56:58.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Changing my personal PC operating system to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & my desk setup","permalink":"/blog/Changing-my-personal-PC-operating-system-to-Ubuntu-20-04-LTS"},"nextItem":{"title":"Horizontal vs vertical scaling and CAP theorom","permalink":"/blog/Horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling-and-CAP-theorom"}},"content":"![syllabus-for-frontend-devs](./assets/syllabus-for-frontend-devs.webp)\\n\\nThere are a plethora of topics about what a senior frontend developer should know.

Let\'s say the tech stack of the project is a CMS like WordPress then the developer thinks that\'s all it takes to be a senior frontend developer. This post is more like normalizing the senior frontend skillset.\\n\\n## What are the tech or libs a senior frontend developer must be familiar in 2021.\\n\\n1. HTML5 with web APIs\\n\\n2. CSS3 with animations & interactions\\n\\n3. Javascript until latest release and babel JS\\n\\n4. React JS with a redux, redux-thunk, and react-router (or anyone lib or framework)\\n\\n5. Date manipulation library like momentJS\\n\\n6. Data visualization library like D3.JS\\n\\n7. A mapping library like google maps\\n\\n8. Responsive web development with/without bootstrap or similar EDL\\n\\n9. Working experience with webpack\\n\\n10. Deployment of reactJS app with whatever backend\\n\\n11. Familiarity with performance patterns \\n\\n12. Experience working with CDN, various media assets.\\n\\n13. Unit testing with JEST, react testing lib\\n\\n14. Setup tooling with npm scripts & work with npm packages.\\n\\n15. Experience in handling authentication, caching, etc on frontend projects.\\n\\n## Here are few more things a senior dev should know to be a professional\\n\\nThe life of a senior developer is never easy because there is a lot to know and perform. Here are a few more things\\n\\n1. Node.JS with framework like loopback\\n\\n2. Experience with creating and consuming REST, GraphQL APIs\\n\\n3. Deploying nodeJS proxy servers with PM2 on Linux\\n\\n4. Knowledge of load balancers and scaling horizontally.\\n\\n5. Create schemas with SQL databases like PostgreSQL\\n\\n6. Work with NoSQL databases like MongoDB\\n\\n7. Talk fluently in algorithms, data structures, and design patterns\\n\\n8. Pick the tech stack for projects\\n\\n9. Estimating software by analyzing mockups\\n\\n10. Build offline web experiences, mobile experiences with React native, and desktop experiences with Electron\\n\\n11. Get into architectural discussions about CSS or any other frontend technologies choices which we have. Architecture discussions are not about which code to sit in which module. The modularization of code is a refactoring discussion the team should do.\\n\\n12. Upgrading packages, implementing CI/CD with tools like Github actions\\n\\n13. Exposure to modern stuff like PWA, SSR, NextJS, Cloud deployments, etc\\n\\n14. Help your team members, give knowledge transfer sessions & conduct tech interviews.\\n\\n15. Get some certifications under your belt or domain knowledge.\\n\\n## The list seems too lengthy, what should I do?\\n\\nThe bad news is that the list mentioned above is not complete in itself. I did not talk about cool things like automation, web security, web assembly, etc. I did not talk about rocky topics like office politics or getting stuck on a tech stack due to org policy etc.\\n\\n> You can leverage on what you know already while you are keeping up with the happenings in the community.\\n\\n## Which websites should I refer to stay updated\\n\\nI recommend bookmarking a couple of websites that you find useful and visit them often. Most websites are going to touch base on topics at a basic level which is not quite useful for senior-level professionals.\\n\\nInvest and find out the niche blogs or publications. Of course, reading books is a great way to stay updated. Writing some code every day is still a good idea. \\n\\n> say hi to open source or problem-solving.\\n\\n## How do senior-level developers manage their time.\\n\\nAs a senior-level dev, I see a lot of developers swamped at work. To escape the swamp they tend to take a vacation yet attend meetings which seem to be an oxymoron. Here is what worked for me.\\n\\n> More than managing time, we need to be good at drawing boundaries around our time, choices. Build a not-to-do list.\\n\\nI do not prefer to attend meetings in the evenings or at night. I use this time for something like blogging, reading, etc. Be ready to close the door and work, when your family members think you have worked enough for the day.\\nss"},{"id":"/Horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling-and-CAP-theorom","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling-and-CAP-theorom","source":"@site/blog/Horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling-and-CAP-theorom.md","title":"Horizontal vs vertical scaling and CAP theorom","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-03-17T12:27:51.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"performance-eng","permalink":"/blog/tags/performance-eng"}],"readingTime":2.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Horizontal vs vertical scaling and CAP theorom","tags":["performance-eng"],"date":"2021-03-17T12:27:51.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Syllabus for senior frontend dev in 2021","permalink":"/blog/Syllabus-for-modern-senior-frontend-dev-2021"},"nextItem":{"title":"Health tips for software teams, that does not cost anything to the firm.","permalink":"/blog/Health-tips-for-software-teams-that-does-not-cost-anything"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/scaling-plants.webp)\\n\\nScaling software is managers pride and engineers headache, Just kidding. Scaling software is a discipline in performance engineering where the software is unable to work normally due to resource constraints arising due to high workload. Let\'s discuss scaling techniques in detail.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## Which is better, building scaled software or building software that can scale?\\n\\nI was fortunate to work in both scenarios. Let me explain a little deeper.\\n\\nScenario A: Software house decides to build a well-scaled product from day 1.\\n\\nScenario B: Software house decides to build software that has the potential to scale when the demand arises.\\n\\nNow let\'s do the cost-benefit analysis in software terms\\n\\ntime: scenario A will take a longer time because the team tries to build a perfectly scaled app. The capacity or load testing is driving more load to the app with bots regularly to check if the app can handle the expected load. scenario B is quicker to complete.\\n\\nscope: Scenario B has a more relevant scope than the synthetic scope induced in scenario A. The more synthetic scope is a risk for startups and manageable for existing products or migration projects.\\n\\nbudget: Scenario A has more fixed costs since the beginning. Scenario B has elastic costs based on how the software performs in the real world.\\n\\n> Building products that have the potential to scale is a nice way to reduce software wastage. Software waste means the software that nobody buys or uses or sometimes never shipped.\\n\\n## Whats vertical scaling\\n\\nImagine you had a normal individual house in India. The house occupied most of the land. To increase the capacity of the house, you have to build more rooms on the terrace and grow vertically. \\n\\nIn the world of infrastructure, the infrastructure is given a boost by replacing parts of the hardware with more capacity like more CPU cores, more RAM, etc. But after a point, we cannot scale it any further because of limitations. The risk of failure is high in vertical scaling.\\n\\n## What about horizontal scaling\\n\\nGetting back to house example, to horizontally scale a house is to buy the house next door and use it for our purpose. Now you have 2 separate houses under your control.\\n\\nIn infrastructure, horizontal scaling is about adding more units of physical servers to handle the load. Horizontal scaling is a preferred technique because if one server fails, the others are still operational.\\n\\nThe software packaging and distribution is complex in horizontal scaling when compared to vertical scaling. Imagine a web application running on separate servers, we need a load balancer to distribute the workload. We also need to keep databases in sync.\\n\\n## Is horizontal and vertical scaling relevant in the cloud\\n\\nyes, it\'s relevant.\\n\\n## What is the CAP theorem\\n\\nCAP theorem is mostly associated with distributed databases that store data on more than one computer or node.

Rampant operations issues, longer meetings can take a toll on software teams and their health. Here are 6 actionable tips which you can follow to keep up your software team\'s health.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n \\n## Another fitness post on the internet?\\n\\nNot really, I am writing about fitness for software teams which are actionable and mostly do not cost a buck to the management. I am also covering physical and mental health.\\n\\n## Here we go, the actionable dev fitness tips for software teams.\\n\\n1. **Fitness cannot be imposed, fitness cannot be ignored in software teams. We can only facilitate the achievement of individual team members\' fitness goals**. For instance, as a lead dev of a team, I get to know who is a morning and an evening person. I can urge them to take a break in the morning/evening and get back to work after a workout break.\\n\\n2. **Stress management should be spoken often in teams**. We veil ourselves from exposing our vulnerabilities in front of the team members in a fear of judgment or missing out on opportunities. But stress at work is real, we need to talk about it and support each other. Uncertainty is a breeding ground for stress. For me, cleaning the work area within 5 minutes helps in reducing stress similarly 10-minute walks after meetings. Each one of your software team members needs to find out what works for them to manage stress.\\n\\n3. **Do not arrange for parties in the evening or starting at night**. Office parties are an event where calorie intake is high plus alcohol at times. It\'s celebration mode but too many calories in the night followed by a working day are not good for your team. You can schedule lunch in the afternoon followed by a walk or some games. At least fitness freaks would balance their night meal portion size and work out the other day.\\n\\n4. **Office pantry to have just free water, rest should be paid/banned, including the big screen TV**. I am not in favor of drinking calories in the form of coffees at work. You can substitute tea with green tea. Stocking biscuits and other snacks in transparent jars is a recipe for failure. Ban soda-based drinks at work.\\n\\n5. **Have a meditation room/area at work**. The busy work culture and laptop screens need to be given a break. Why not a room for meditation. If it does not work, let them take a nap.\\n\\n6. **Long meetings to have a mandatory timeout of 10 minutes after 40 minutes duration**. The team can use 10 minutes for taking a power walk or visiting the washroom. There is a study which says spending long hours in the car leads to an increase in weight, the same holds good for meetings. Lot said but less is done in teams about conducting effective and short meetings.\\n\\n## Why only 6 tips?\\n\\nBecause each software team is unique, as a leader you need to think about the software team\'s fitness and come up with actionable items. \\n\\n## Why not give freebies like cookies at work at 3 pm?\\n\\nIf you are thinking of distributing freebies to your team at 3 pm like cookies and squeeze work out of them in the evening, it\'s not a great idea ethically. To me, it looks unethical as you are slowly reducing the quality of your team members\' health. Some of them might put on 7kgs body weight in a year due to this.\\n\\n## Any advice for individual team members?\\n\\nWatch three things daily\\n\\n- Amount of food you eat\\n\\n- Amount of exercise you do\\n\\n- How are you feeling both physically and mentally\\n\\nSometimes analyze or monitor the numbers like body weight, blood pressure, and other test reports"},{"id":"/Dependabot-alerts-on-github-explained","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Dependabot-alerts-on-github-explained","source":"@site/blog/Dependabot-alerts-on-github-explained.md","title":"Dependabot alerts on github explained","description":"Some alt text","date":"2021-03-14T09:39:24.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"software-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-tools"}],"readingTime":1.94,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Dependabot alerts on github explained","tags":["software-tools"],"date":"2021-03-14T09:39:24.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Health tips for software teams, that does not cost anything to the firm.","permalink":"/blog/Health-tips-for-software-teams-that-does-not-cost-anything"},"nextItem":{"title":"The science behind single page applications or frontend SPA","permalink":"/blog/The-science-behind-single-page-applications-or-frontend-SPA"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/dependabot.webp)\\n\\n\\nDependabot is a bot or assistant that can help with security updates of your dependencies. Phew, that\'s cool right. A bot taking care of your application security threats. Here are more details about the dependabot.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What is the link between GitHub and dependabot?\\n\\nDependabot is a GitHub company. Looks like they got acquired by GitHub so dependabot services are exclusive for the GitHub platform. There is no mention of integrating dependabot with Bitbucket or GitLab.\\n\\n## How to enable Dependabot alerts?\\n\\nThe more appropriate question would be how to disable dependabot alerts because by default when you go to settings > security & analysis you will see\\n\\n1. Dependency graph which is enabled and no way to disable it so all your app dependencies are always scanned for security issues.\\n\\n2. Dependabot alerts - the bot communicates with you (the repo owner) through alerts. The alerts could also be related to new vulnerabilities which impact the dependencies.\\n\\n3. Dependabot security updates - This is a priceless feature. The easy upgrade of dependencies is provided through a pull request whenever a security update is found.\\n\\n## How to see dependabot alerts\\n\\nIf you are the repo owner, there is a new tab called a security that is seen alongside the wiki tab.\\n\\nInside the security tab, you can find vertical tabs with dependabot alerts.\\n\\nWhen you click on the alert, the detailed description can be seen along with the code. The fix can be converted to a pull request by the repo owner/admin.\\n\\n## How about pull requests created by the bot.\\n\\nFor very high severity security issues, the bot will automatically create a pull request. The repo owner can merge the pull request in one click.\\n\\nThe dependabot also follows good practices like creating a branch and put a pull request with a good title.\\n\\n## I want to configure dependabot further, what can I do\\n\\n1.

The browsers need to think about their customer\'s mobile data before serving the full website which on average weighs 3MB. In chrome we have a setting called data saver, let us dig deeper into it.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What is the objective of the data saver?\\n\\nBefore we understand more about chrome lite or data saver setting, we need to understand that data saving is an option only on the Android Chrome browser. The data saver on chrome is not applicable for Desktop chrome or IOS devices.\\n\\nThe data saver objectives could be \\n\\n1. Loading page faster when the page loads slowly on mobile data.\\n\\n2. Save mobile data utilization.\\n\\n> The documentation says that chrome data saving works mostly when the phone is using mobile data. I believe it\'s ignored mostly when on Wifi connections. But it might kick in when the page loads slowly on mobile.\\n\\n## How does chrome data saver works\\n\\nThe documentation uses a phrase called \\"Google servers\\" or \\"Google data compression proxy\\".\\n\\nThe page is loaded on the google servers first and the light-weight version is sent to the Android chrome browser so that the objectives are met.\\n\\n## Can it affect your web app functionality\\n\\nThe answer is a yes and a no.\\n\\nStatic content which gets rendered at once will work normally. The dynamic content like lazy loading etc might face some issues. These issues can be identified quickly with a proof of concept at the beginning stages of the application.\\n\\nHowever, the defects arising out of the data saving mode would be minimal in my opinion because it makes Android chrome an unreliable platform for developers.\\n\\n## Other things about data saving\\n\\n- The data saving setting is not clearly under our influence. The Google servers can change the rules suddenly which can impact our website.\\n\\n- Testing on newer versions of Android chrome with Canary builds can mitigate the risk of some functionality not working on Android chrome with data saver.\\n\\n- Data saving won\'t work with incognito mode or private windows like guest mode.\\n\\n- Images will be optimized by google servers before sending to Android chrome while on mobile data.\\n\\n## How to programmatically detect data saving in chrome\\n\\nAll things related to the browser are mostly with navigator objects. We can check with the navigator property.\\n\\n```javascript\\nif (navigator.connection.saveData) {\\n    console.log(\\"data saver on\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## How to know more about \\"Chrome lite mode\\"?\\n\\nYou should google for \\"Google data compression proxy\\".

Having said that, unused CSS easily gets shipped to production despite modern build. One of the CSS pruning libraries is `purgeCSS`. Let\'s see how purgeCSS works with react CRA.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What is Unused CSS?\\n\\nLet us say we use Bootstrap CSS for styling the webpage, style the components, etc. When your package for production, the styles which are not relevant to your web app get added to the CSS file because there is no `tree-shaking` concept in traditional CSS build tools.\\n\\nBack in `gulp JS` days, the CSS files were \\n\\n1. piped from their source to the system\\n2. Converted into a bundle &\\n3. later minified\\n \\n The minified bundle was later gzipped before sending the data from the server to the client. Despite the three-step process, the unused CSS was still shipped to production leading to several KiloBytes of unwanted code shipped to a client.\\n\\n## How to know if your site has unused CSS\\n\\nFollow the below steps\\n\\n1. Open chrome dev tools\\n\\n2. Goto Elements tab\\n\\n3. Click on the 3 dots next to the close button on the top right\\n\\n4. Goto `more tools` > `coverage`\\n\\n5. This should open a tab next to the console\\n\\n6. Click on the refresh icon\\n\\nThe page loads and we can see the unused Bytes in both CSS and JS\\n\\n> The particular CSS code may be unused in the current Html page but used in other pages. So do not jump to a conclusion and remove them.\\n\\n## How to manage unused CSS\\n\\nWhen it comes to JS, we can get a little smarter by importing the required modules out of the library like\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport {isUndefined} from \'lodash\';\\n```\\n\\nBut in traditional CSS frameworks like `bootstrap`, we do not have any such options. We have to import the whole CSS file unless you choose the `sass` way to consume CSS.\\n\\nUtility first CSS frameworks like tailwind CSS have a different approach to how CSS gets consumed and reused. If not careful, you may be importing the whole CSS utility file `.css` in Html leading to a lot of unused CSS\\n\\n> Manually managing unused CSS is not an option. We need to use tools that work at the building level.\\n\\n## Any popular nodeJS based CSS cleaning libraries out there?\\n\\nA quick google gave few names like \\n\\n1. PurgeCSS\\n\\n2. PureCSS etc\\n\\nIn my opinion, PurgeCSS had the flexibility through configuration which we can integrate to build tools like webpack.\\n\\n## How about react CRA?\\n\\nOut of the box, purgeCSS is not going to work with react-scripts. The document mentions `CRACO` JS library. [Craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco/blob/master/packages/craco/README.md) is an interesting library that alleviates the problem of missing configuration in CRA. You have to replace `react-scripts` with `craco` in the npm scripts.\\n\\nI did not find this setup appealing because the configuration file is quite lengthy and its one JS module which holds all the configuration for \\n\\n1. Webpack\\n\\n2. eslint\\n\\n3. CSS \\n\\nRefer <a href=\\"https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco/blob/master/packages/craco/README.md#configuration-file\\">Github Repo</a>\\n\\nI still tried craco with Purge CSS with React CRA without ejecting. Still, the build system was not working.\\n\\nI tried to run PostCSS with purgeCSS on top of the build folder contents. Alas seems like a dream run but this setup also did not work. Most of the blog posts were half-baked or copy-paste.\\n\\n## What\'s the status?\\n\\nIt is still a work in progress. I will keep you posted when I have a breakthrough.\\n\\nTill then keep referring to stack overflow <a href=\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/css-purge?sort=unanswered\\">Stackoverflow</a>"},{"id":"/Fixed-lighthouse-audit-to-100-on-my-blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Fixed-lighthouse-audit-to-100-on-my-blog","source":"@site/blog/Fixed-lighthouse-audit-to-100-on-my-blog.md","title":"Fixed lighthouse SEO audit to 100 on my blog","description":"lighthouse score","date":"2021-02-18T16:28:42.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"performance-eng","permalink":"/blog/tags/performance-eng"}],"readingTime":2.29,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Fixed lighthouse SEO audit to 100 on my blog","tags":["performance-eng"],"date":"2021-02-18T16:28:42.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"It\'s hard to setup purgeCSS with react CRA","permalink":"/blog/Its-hard-to-setup-purgecss-with-react-CRA"},"nextItem":{"title":"Does alexa have a purpose at my work place?","permalink":"/blog/Alexa-at-office-setup"}},"content":"![lighthouse score](./assets/lighthouse-score-dhbalaji.webp)\\n\\nLighthouse is an amazing audit tool to check the performance of the website based on certain rules.

We already had an amazing platform that was high scorer on the lighthouse. We had (just) two issues. Here is how we fixed the issues.\\n\\n### Links not crawlable\\n\\nHey, the problem description was \\"Links not crawlable\\". It\'s self-explanatory. The links refer to the `a` or anchor tags on my blog. The anchor tags were not crawlable because they did not have a `href`. The theme developer had used anchor tags for styling purposes.\\n\\n**Fix:** The fix was to change the anchor tag to a span tag. The CSS got distorted but it was promptly corrected in `stylus lang`.\\n\\n### Links do not have descriptive text\\n\\nThe problem links to anchor tags. The anchor tags had text which was not descriptive. When I checked the markup, the text was _\\"Read more\\"_. I felt that was descriptive but according to lighthouse terms like here, click here, etc are considered non-descriptive.\\n\\nI changed the text to \\"Continue reading\\". That fixed the problem.\\n\\nThe SEO score raised to 100%.\\n\\n![lighthouse score](./assets/lighthouse-score-dhbalaji-fixed.webp)\\n\\n## How to run the lighthouse\\n\\nThough it\'s easy to run from the very tab where you are browsing, I do not recommend this approach as there are chrome extensions also working with the DOM.\\n\\nI prefer opening chrome in guest mode or incognito and run the lighthouse audit on the production build.\\n\\nYou can create a production build on the local and run `serve`.\\n\\n## What\'s next on the SEO front\\n\\nThere are a lot of areas of improvement.\\n\\n1. The blog has multiple pages which need to be checked. Right now the audit has run on the home page only.\\n\\n2. We are experimenting with tools like Screaming frog SEO spider. More information about this tool coming later.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n- Lighthouse is an amazing audit tool\\n\\n- Follow the lighthouse recommendation to get the score to 100\\n\\n- Sometimes code stuck within EDL or design language is hard to modify.

Based on your permission the tracking continues or discontinues in theory.\\n\\nThings like tracking user behavior, selling data is something to be done based on user consent. That\'s why many companies changed their terms of use and spammed our inboxes when GDPR was announced.\\n\\nThis is the reason why websites ask for user consent when working with cookies for other purposes. My blog does not have a cookie policy because there are no ads or tracking except for google analytics.\\n\\n## How to implement third party cookie on your website\\n\\nTo understand this we need to know how a cookie is set. A cookie is sent and received by the browser through HTTP request headers. When an HTTP request contains a cookie header then the cookie gets set for that domain from where it loaded.\\n\\nBefore we get there we need to know about the 2 basic terminologies.\\n\\n1. First party cookie - They are generated, set on the same domain. Dhbalaji. dev website sets a cookie to Dhbalaji. dev. In programming, anything \\"First\\" has certain enhanced features. In the first-party cookie, we can set and read the cookie from Dhbalaji. dev.\\n\\n2. Third-party cookie - This cookie is generated from another website and set to that website through an intermediate site. For instance, I have 2 websites (one not working though) bookstoc.com & Dhbalaji. dev. I want to track if the user visiting Dhbalaji. dev is visiting bookstoc.com. \\n\\nI would set a cookie to the bookstoc.com website from Dhbalaji. dev. In this case, the cookie can never be read from Dhbalaji. dev but it can be read from bookstoc.com. Based on cookie content I can be aware of user behavior.\\n\\n## Let\'s get to the code\\n\\nUnderstanding that cookies are transported through HTTP request headers is an important concept. It\'s not uncommon to find developers not knowing how cookies get transported on the internet.\\n\\n**User story**: Given the business owner has 2 websites, when the visitors visit his first website A1 then the cookie needs to be set on another website A2\\n\\n**Analysis**: Though setting a cookie on the same domain happens through `document. cookie` Javascript, but the same cannot be used to set cookies to A2. We need to use an HTTP request from the A2 website/domain.\\n\\n**Solution**: Load a 1px transparent pixel from the A2 website from A1. You need to add an image tag, since it\'s a small image there will neither layout change nor performance issue. I do not recommend using hidden images, they are never loaded to DOM. When the image loads then the cookie is set to A2 from A1\\n\\n## Any caveats?\\n\\nIt\'s the browser on which the above user story needs to be tested. For instance, browsers can completely block cookies or some extensions can block third party cookies, etc. So 100% working solutions cannot be guaranteed.\\n\\n## What goes into cookie content?\\n\\nI was not very curious about cookie content. Here is my guess. The cookie can have an encrypted code which the network of websites can decipher or share information.\\n\\nFor example, the ad networks can have cookie set of different websites which contain tracking information useful for serving ads."},{"id":"/Learning-npm-and-apt-package-managers-at-once","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Learning-npm-and-apt-package-managers-at-once","source":"@site/blog/Learning-npm-and-apt-package-managers-at-once.md","title":"Learning npm and apt package manager commands at once","description":"gift packages","date":"2021-01-09T21:59:32.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"software-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-tools"}],"readingTime":2.66,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Learning npm and apt package manager commands at once","tags":["software-tools"],"date":"2021-01-09T21:59:32.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"WTF is this cookie policy alerts, third pary cookies on websites, etc","permalink":"/blog/WTF-is-this-cookie-policy-alerts-on-websites"},"nextItem":{"title":"10 inspiring thoughts from developers guide book by John Somnez","permalink":"/blog/5-inspiring-thoughts-from-developers-guide-book-by-John-Somnez"}},"content":"![gift packages](./assets/packages.webp)\\n\\nYou cannot be a professional developer without an encounter with Unix/Linux systems. Linux is the preferred operating system of choice for cloud machines. `SSH` is a magical technology to control the cloud machine without making a trip to the data center. All said but how to install and manage software on the Linux operating systems? The answer is **Package Managers**.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why are you comparing npm and APT?\\n\\nI am comparing `npm` with `apt` because both implement the same interface called `Package Managers`. Might have sounded more Javaish but the point is that both npm and apt are package managers.\\n\\nFamiliarity with `npm` makes it easy to learn `apt`. Another easy way would be to compare the app store with `apt` however we do not execute commands on the app store. But the concept is the same, you can look up software, install it, upgrade it or even remove it.\\n\\n## What are the operations performed by package managers? \\n\\nThe package manager is part of a package called `Package management system`. The package management system has a bunch of tools to perform operations on the software like maintaining a registry of available software, performing a lookup when searched for, notifying or maintaining versions of the software. For the node platform, we have `npm`, for python, it\'s `pip`, etc. Depending on the Linux OS the package managers vary.\\n\\n## What about GUI based package managers?\\n\\nI enjoy using GUI based package managers like synaptic package manager on my laptop but never on cloud computing because they do not have GUI. It\'s just `SSH`.\\n\\n## Package managers do CRUD?\\n\\nCRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete operations in general. Package managers help you similar, in place of creating we have `install`.\\n\\nTo create a package\\n\\nnpm - `npm init`\\napt - no equivalent command exists\\n\\nTo install a package(s)\\n\\nnpm - `npm install`\\napt - `apt i`\\n\\nMultiple packages are separated with a space like `apt i pack1 pack2.\\n\\nTo install a package with a specific version. In npm, we use the same install command to reinstall the package. In apt, we pass `--reinstall`.\\n\\nnpm - `npm install packageName@1.1.0`\\napt - `apt i packageName=1.1.0`\\n\\nTo remove a package\\n\\nnpm - `npm remove packageName`\\napt - `apt remove packageName`\\n\\nTo update a package\\n\\nnpm - `npm update packageName`\\napt - `apt update packageName`\\n\\nTo upgrade a package (a breaking release can be considered an upgrade. Bugfixes are considered an update).\\n\\nnpm - `npm upgrade packageName`\\napt - `apt upgrade packageName`\\n\\nTo upgrade all packages, `npm upgrade` or `apt upgrade`.\\n\\nTo remove unwanted packages along with configuration files\\n\\nnpm - `npm purge packageName`\\napt - `apt purge packageName`\\n\\nTo list the existing packages\\n\\nnpm - `npm list -g --depth=0`\\napt - `apt list`\\n\\n## How to clear the cache\\n\\nThe cache is the area where the packages are downloaded. We have one location where the packages are cached per user in an OS.\\n\\nnpm - `npm cache clear`\\napt - `apt clean`\\n\\n## Are there other things to know\\n\\nAs a publisher of not so popular npm package [send JS errors to service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/send-js-errors-to-backend), I was looking for equivalents of `npm publish`, `npm login` however I did not find an equivalent in `apt`."},{"id":"/5-inspiring-thoughts-from-developers-guide-book-by-John-Somnez","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/5-inspiring-thoughts-from-developers-guide-book-by-John-Somnez","source":"@site/blog/5-inspiring-thoughts-from-developers-guide-book-by-John-Somnez.md","title":"10 inspiring thoughts from developers guide book by John Somnez","description":"book praise","date":"2021-01-08T15:30:22.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-books","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-books"}],"readingTime":5.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"10 inspiring thoughts from developers guide book by John Somnez","tags":["tech-books"],"date":"2021-01-08T15:30:22.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Learning npm and apt package manager commands at once","permalink":"/blog/Learning-npm-and-apt-package-managers-at-once"},"nextItem":{"title":"Shell programming, vi & Linux commands from the online course - summary","permalink":"/blog/Shell-programming-vi-commands-from-online-course-summary"}},"content":"![book praise](./assets/developer-career-guide.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn somnez is the software developer guru who writes books and creates content for other developers. He is prolific, brilliant, and healthy at the same time. Needless to say, he is someone who can work 18 hours a day for years. His book is like Gita for developers. Here are 10 inspiring ideas that caught my attention. The complete software developers career guide is a fantastic read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n \\r\\n## About this read\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complete software developers career guide is the second book by John somnez which I have finished reading. The first one being soft skills from manning publications. I like the way he writes self-help books. Generally, self-help books get boring but not this one. At a page count of 775, it\'s a heavy and gripping read.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did all the reading on the kindle app installed on my 10-inch Lenovo tab. The book itself was borrowed on [prime reading](https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/A-developers-review-of-Amazon-Prime-Reading-what-works-what-doesn-t/), so technically its free read, and I returned the book on kindle.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The 10 inspiring thoughts from the complete developer\'s career guide\\r\\n\\r\\nI would say these are just some of the inspiring thoughts, the book has quite a good number of tips for developers.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Filling in gaps in knowledge to ace any interview. \\r\\n\\r\\n    Most people from non-computer science engineering backgrounds find data structures and algorithms hard. When you understand it\'s a knowledge gap and work on the gaps, then it becomes easy for you to crack interviews. The keyword is **Knowledge gaps**\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Work proactively on employer business goals and get promoted.\\r\\n \\r\\n    It\'s very tempting to sharpen our programming IQ, over-engineer a solution & architect to perfection but **what matters for your career growth is whether your ideas at work make money for the business or not**. If your business is making 1 million because of your work, they will be happy to give you a raise or even a whole department to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Sometimes the best way to move forward in a career could be outside your company. \\r\\n\\r\\n    Let\'s say despite all the best moves and hard work from your side if the company is citing lack of funds as a reason to skip your promotion, it\'s better to get promoted elsewhere. **If your employer finds you valuable, they will go beyond the books to retain you.**\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Be an inspiring leader at work by being 10x better than others.\\r\\n \\r\\n    Many people are leading teams in a hard way. But **an inspiring leader is the one who is 10x hard working and would want the team members to succeed**. Good leaders don\'t just abdicate the task but they also take ownership of its outcome. Instead of just throwing in a task to your team, it would be nice if the leader has good written communication skills and share a wiki document with the team. Sharing the wiki is not a ticket to abdicate the task but a responsible leader will also train the team on the wiki.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Branching out to be on your programmer entrepreneur slowly and safely.\\r\\n \\r\\n Most developers dream to be on their own someday. **John had taken the route from contractor, employee, and finally a tech entrepreneur.** He is successful at it. He has become an authority and has published 18 courses of Pluralsight through which he made millions. He has actionable tips for those to be entreprogrammers\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Market yourself to gain visibility and gain an audience. \\r\\n\\r\\n    ** Let\'s say you are an amazing programmer but nobody knows you. You will be paid less for your skills** But if you are an above-average programmer but with a lot of visibility, then you will be paid more for your skills. Visibility through marketing your brand matters.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Be known in the community. Speak somewhere is the mantra.\\r\\n \\r\\n    **Either it\'s on youtube or in local meetups or on podcasts, just speak.** That\'s one way to grow your network by adding more value to others. John says he gets more hits on youtube than on his blog. If speaking is a problem, join toastmasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Be contradicting to be more charismatic. \\r\\n\\r\\n    John\'s physique is of a wrestler but he is a software developer. Isn\'t that contradicting, most software devs I know are overweight slobs or look tired to maintain a good physique including myself? **Being charismatic is important to get a good impression from others.** However a tattoo in the visible region could lead to prejudices and a recruiter may not give you a job. Be careful.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Dressing & image correction for devs. \\r\\n\\r\\n    Software devs have no prescribed dress code like lawyers which means they have more choices about what they wear. But **always dress like your boss\'s boss or super boss**. Dressing two levels up is a good thing and will get noticed by people at work.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Multi purposing your actions. \\r\\n\\r\\n    Multi-tasking is most talked about and sometimes dangerous if you mix driving with talking on the phone. **Multi purposing means one activity has multiple positive outcomes.** For instance I can use this blog post to showcase my reading skills, use the same content for my book talk, and also to practice my written communication. John mixes audiobooks with his 10k runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are 12 bonus chapter names from the book.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. How to treat women in tech\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Choosing programming languages\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Generalist or specialist\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Fitness for programmers\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Importance of blogging\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Billing for freelancers\\r\\n\\r\\n7. When to be contractor vs employee\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Decoding job offers and choosing the best\\r\\n\\r\\n9. How to move from tester to developer\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Should I go for lunch with team members or stay in my gang forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. ToDo certifications or not\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Awesome book recommendations for readers were included. The e-myth busted is the one I want to read next.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Closing notes\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best books I have read. Inspiring and feels authentic. I highly recommend and it is a must-read. The advice is not restricted to people in the USA, it applies to everyone."},{"id":"/Shell-programming-vi-commands-from-online-course-summary","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Shell-programming-vi-commands-from-online-course-summary","source":"@site/blog/Shell-programming-vi-commands-from-online-course-summary.md","title":"Shell programming, vi & Linux commands from the online course - summary","description":"online course","date":"2020-12-19T15:22:23.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"}],"readingTime":4.41,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Shell programming, vi & Linux commands from the online course - summary","tags":["learning"],"date":"2020-12-19T15:22:23.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"10 inspiring thoughts from developers guide book by John Somnez","permalink":"/blog/5-inspiring-thoughts-from-developers-guide-book-by-John-Somnez"},"nextItem":{"title":"Simple feature switch ReactJS component in 5 lines of code","permalink":"/blog/Simple-feature-switch-ReactJS-component-in-5-lines-of-code"}},"content":"![online course](./assets/online-course.webp)\\n\\nI love online courses, it resembles the computer lab at college. The recent operations issues at work demanded me to get educated to combat the sudden hiccups. Here we go, the summary of the online course by a fellow Indian.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What was the motivator to take up this course?\\n\\nAny good software engineer should know 2 things,\\n\\n1. How would his/her application work outside of localhost or in production mode?\\n\\n2. What factors could affect the performance of the application in production because the localhost is generally an unconstrained environment? \\n\\nAs a frontend engineer, the amazing react components and well cached static assets would be useless if the REST APIs do not give the response in time or they timeout.\\n\\nWhen the user traffic increases, the server resources get constrained like the CPU, memory, or the hard disk running out of space. When we wear the `operations engineer` hat, we should know to check the state of Linux servers. That\'s where I found the knowledge gap. Commands like `grep`, `find` were new to me. So I took up this course.\\n\\n\\n## Talk about the course\\n\\nThe course was well structured into 3 categories\\n\\n1. The basic Linux commands, user management\\n\\n2. Check health status, find & grep\\n\\n3. Vim editor, shell programming & crontab\\n\\n## Linux commands that were discussed\\n\\nBefore we jump into the commands, we need to know the Linux variants like Ubuntu, Red hat enterprise, etc. The commands might have little variation.\\n\\n`whoami`, `who`, `clear`, `hostname`, `ifconfig`, `sudo`, `id`\\n\\nEvery user is part of one or more groups. Users with Sudo access are part of `sudo` group or `wheel` in RHEL.\\n\\n> Sudo is also a user group in Linux\\n\\nHere are the user management commands\\n\\n`adduser`, `usermod`, `deluser` & `su`\\n\\nwhen a new user is added, an entry is created in `/etc/passwd`\\n\\nOther file related commands `compress`, `cd`, `cd -`, `ls -lart`,\\n\\nTo create nested folders `mkdir -p` & to have an interactive remove `rm -i`. To remove the empty folder `rmdir`. If the folder has contents `rm -rf`.\\n\\nTo see the content of the files\\n\\n- `cat` - displays all the contents of the file.\\n- `less`\\n- `head`\\n- `tail`\\n\\nSingle letters which have a meaning when using `chmod`\\n\\na - all\\nw - write\\nr - read\\nx - execute\\nu - user\\ng - group\\no - other\\n\\n## Shell scripting basics\\n\\n> shell scripts need executable permission\\n\\n1. the Linux commands work inside the shell script\\n\\n2. There are 2 ways you can input data to shell script. They are through the `read` command and others are `arguments`. The args can be found in `$1, $2` but `$0` is taken.\\n\\n3. The conditional and looping constructs are available in shell scripts\\n\\n4. I am not sure about garbage collection etc if they are available \\n\\n5. Each shell script has its process id. The shell script could be running in the foreground or background.\\n\\n6. `bash -x` to debug shell script. Simplest debugging experience than in any language.\\n\\n## Server health check commands and kill the process in Linux\\n\\nYou need to know about how the process gets created and gets deleted.\\n\\nTo know all running process `ps -ef`. To kill the process `kill -1 PID`\\n\\nPID stands for process id, PPID stands for parents process id.\\n\\n### Memory, Disks\\n\\nTo know the free memory `free -h` in a human-readable format.\\n\\nTo know the free space on the disk `df -h`, for disk usage or size of files its `du -skh folderName`.\\n\\n`top` command to know more about system resources in one go.\\n\\n> `$$` will give the process id of the bash shell itself\\n\\nTo filter out a particular process you will need to grep it `ps -ef | grep $pid`\\n\\n## Transfer control from one command to another\\n\\n`>` where data is inputted to the script on the right, the data originated from the expression on the left side of the `>`. \\n\\n`<` where data is inputted to the script on the right. The others are the same as `>`\\n\\n`>>` Append the input data to the file on the right of `>>`\\n\\n`|` pipe, by far the most used operator where you can chain commands to work on the data. Executed from left to right. Eg. `ps -ef | grep 3728`\\n\\n## Other useful ones\\n\\n`find` command, it takes a variety of filters like type, size, updated date, name wildcard. `find ./ -type f -name *.txt | head -10`\\n\\nTo exec action on the output of find, we can use `-exec` or pipe with `| xargs`\\n\\nSearch for text with `grep -i word`, for multiple words `-e`, to avoid a word `-v`.\\n     \\n I got used to VI editor but the ability to turn on line numbers was new `set number`. `yy` to copy the line and `p` to paste the line.\\n \\n## How did you practice the commands\\n \\n Red hat enterprise 7 on the windows 10 pro-Hyper V and ubuntu 20.04 on the windows subsystem for Linux.\\n \\n## Were there any new commands that were new to you\\n\\ncrontab for executing cron jobs on the Linux. That\'s a timed background process with the ability to capture the output or log the response to a file for debugging. All of what I said above in a line. Linux is full of surprises.\\n\\n## Best way to remember Unix commands? \\n\\nCheatsheets & use it frequently.

Your customer may or may not like the feature. In this case, you may have to turn off the feature for some users & turn it on for the rest. This is called A/B testing. But how to build components to conditional render the content. We can build `feature-switch` components.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What is a Feature switch?\\n\\nThink of a switch for a light bulb. When you turn on the switch, the light is turned on. When the switch is turned off, the light goes away.\\n\\nFeature switch in software is analogous to the switch in the physical world. The feature switch component has a predicate that will decide if a particular feature is to be rendered or not.\\n\\n## What are the use cases of feature switch\\n\\n- Feature switch helps in rapid software development. Till the feature is complete, you can turn off the feature for everyone except the developer working on it.\\n\\n- Feature switches make the software flexible for A/B testing.\\n\\n- Makes development scalable. There is no need to duplicate predicate code to turn a feature on/off in many places of the application.\\n\\n## What are the core parts of a feature-switch component\\n\\n- the feature switch component should have a predicate. The predicate is a function that returns a true or false. Based on the predicate we render the component.\\n\\n- the feature switch should have a target or child component which should be rendered when the predicate returns true.\\n\\n- the feature switch should be highly reusable with standard props whose data should be available wherever the feature is rendered. \\n\\n- to get the feature props, you can write a selector and reuse it.\\n\\n- lastly, the feature switch should be a pure function.\\n\\n## Why not use `if-else` in place of feature-switch\\n\\n- Feature switch component ensures the code is DRY (Don\'t Repeat Yourself). \\n\\n- If-else is a maintenance nightmare. Developers are often tempted to use `&&` to make the condition complex. Complex if-else conditions make the code harder to read.\\n\\n- We can write the code to look more `declarative` with components.\\n\\n## Show me the code.\\n\\nLet\'s build a farm-app that shows the fruits on the physical farm for shoppers in the city. The farm owner wants to experiment with Mango only on a few days of the week. He wants a feature switch functionality so he can show/hide based on some variable value.\\n\\nThe Declarative code would be like. The farm owner would be commenting on the code on a few days of the week when he wants to hide the functionality.\\n\\nCode without feature switch, dev needs to comment out the component at many places in code.\\n\\n```javascript\\n<FarmApp>\\n    <Display type={\'Apple\'} count={500}/>\\n    <Display type={\'Mango\'} count={10}/>\\n    /*<Display type={\'Guava\'} count={30}/>*/\\n</FarmApp>\\n```\\n\\nLets write the feature switch, which is a functional component.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React from \'react\';\\n\\nconst YES = true;\\nconst NO = false;\\n\\nconst fruitsOnSale = {\\n    Apple: YES,\\n    Mango: YES,\\n    Guava: NO\\n};\\n\\nconst FruitsDisplaySwitch = (props) => {\\n    const {type, children} = props;\\n    if (fruitsOnSale[fruitType]) {\\n        return <React.Fragment>{children}</React.Fragment>;\\n    }\\n    return null;\\n}\\n\\nexport default FruitsDisplaySwitch;\\n```\\n\\nUsing the above `FruitsDisplaySwitch` would make our code look like below. The developer need not comment anything to turn ON/OFF. Just change the `fruitsOnSale` object.\\n\\n```javascript\\n    <FarmApp>\\n        <FruitsDisplaySwitch type={\'Apple\'}>\\n            <Display type={\'Apple\'} count={500}/>\\n        </FruitsDisplaySwitch>\\n        <FruitsDisplaySwitch type={\'Mango\'}>\\n            <Display type={\'Mango\'} count={10}/>\\n        </FruitsDisplaySwitch>\\n        <FruitsDisplaySwitch type={\'Guava\'}>\\n            <Display type={\'Guava\'} count={30}/>\\n        </FruitsDisplaySwitch>\\n    </FarmApp>      \\n```"},{"id":"/Work-around-for-dead-laptop-keyboard-keys-in-windows-10","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Work-around-for-dead-laptop-keyboard-keys-in-windows-10","source":"@site/blog/Work-around-for-dead-laptop-keyboard-keys-in-windows-10.md","title":"Work around for dead laptop keyboard keys in windows 10","description":"Sharp keys","date":"2020-12-13T23:56:23.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"dev-work","permalink":"/blog/tags/dev-work"}],"readingTime":1.38,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Work around for dead laptop keyboard keys in windows 10","tags":["dev-work"],"date":"2020-12-13T23:56:23.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Simple feature switch ReactJS component in 5 lines of code","permalink":"/blog/Simple-feature-switch-ReactJS-component-in-5-lines-of-code"},"nextItem":{"title":"WFH vs Remote working & the WFH allowance analysis","permalink":"/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working"}},"content":"![Sharp keys](./assets/SharpKeys.webp)\\n\\nThe laptop keyboard is a critical input device.

Adding to the puzzle was the 20000 to 50000 INR work from home allowance given by employers to set up or upgrade work from home infrastructure. Let\'s understand the what, how, why about the WFH allowance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n \\n## What is the difference between WFH and remote working?\\n\\nWork from home or WFH is a temporary arrangement till the pandemic subsides whereas remote working is an employer mindset where employees are empowered to work from wherever they live.\\n\\nWFH will soon subside but remote working will last forever. In the future companies adopting WFH will reduce the number given the vaccine and adaptability. \\n\\nUnderstanding the difference between WFH and remote working is critical to analyze how companies tried to narrow down the WFH financial allowance budget per employee.\\n\\n## What is this WFH allowance\\n\\n> WFH allowance is a no questions asked one-time payment given to employees to set up or fix their home office\\n\\nThe good news is that employees got some extra cash. Here is a news article from [TOI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/covid-shot-companies-offer-wfh-allowance/articleshow/77568540.cms#:~:text=The%20Indian%20division%20of%20Salesforce,norm%20and%20include%20more%20facilities.) about how Salesforce India gives its employees 250$ for setting up a home office in India.\\n\\nThe list goes on\\n\\n- Google India gives 1000$\\n\\n- G7 CR ships chairs & tables\\n\\n- Springworks a one time allowance of 25000 INR\\n\\n## Why do companies give WFH allowance\\n\\nThere are 2 aspects to this allowance\\n\\n1. The employers want to partially fund your WFH infrastructure so that there is no dip in productivity due to trivial reasons like power cuts or backaches due to missing ergonomics. Gently the employers have put the ball in employees\' court. The employees cannot blame problems like no UPS, no rolling chair, etc. The employees are bound to fix the work environment problems with WFH assistance money.\\n\\n    For readers outside India, stable uninterrupted electricity is not guaranteed. Sometimes we have full-day power cuts and uninformed power cuts. Internet being a private sector asset, the quality is good.\\n\\n2. The WFH allowance is a quick fix to the bigger problem like keeping employees motivated amidst pay cuts, no promotions, and lack of appraisals. It\'s like taking a DOLO 650 tablet during a long grueling bus journey, it gives temporary relief.\\n\\n## What can be done with WFH allowance\\n\\nOf course, you can buy WFH accessories like\\n\\n- Worktable\\n\\n- Rolling chair\\n\\n- UPS connection\\n\\n- Extra monitor\\n\\n- Keyboard & mouse\\n\\n- mid-range mobile/tablet (to install the office communicator)\\n\\n- Coffee machine if you are a coffee fan\\n\\nYou can buy one or two from the above list. It\'s very unlikely that you can buy all of the above from the nominal WFH.\\n\\n## What you cannot buy from WFH allowance\\n\\nThere are many things you cannot buy\\n\\n1. You cannot buy more space for a dedicated WFH experience. My working place has enough space for a 4 feet table, rolling chair, UPS, etc but it\'s part of the bedroom. It means I cannot offer late-night operations support like the way I did at the office.\\n\\n2. Shielding from external noises is a challenge. It\'s very common to hear sounds from Indian kitchens, roads, and people talking in the background. Due to smaller households, it\'s a challenge to keep noises low during meetings.\\n\\n3. No psychological on/off for Work mode. Most employees report working longer hours at home because there is no start & end time.\\n\\n4. We cannot buy the social networking aspect of the office. No social connection with colleagues and fewer chances of making friends.\\n\\n5. You cannot buy top-end accessories, good ergonomic products like the stand-up desk which is the easy upside of 25000 INR.\\n\\n## Is this WFH allowance enough for employees?\\n\\nI appreciate the effort taken by employers to partially finance the employee\'s WFH environment amidst tough times. WFH allowance comes as soother after employees missed their hikes and variable pays.\\n\\nThe amount is certainly enough to buy one or two items but cannot fund the entire home office."},{"id":"/Cache-busting-get-calls-with-cache-control-headers","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Cache-busting-get-calls-with-cache-control-headers","source":"@site/blog/Cache-busting-get-calls-with-cache-control-headers.md","title":"Cache busting GET calls with cache-control headers","description":"cache calls","date":"2020-12-09T07:58:41.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":6.75,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Cache busting GET calls with cache-control headers","tags":["frontend"],"date":"2020-12-09T07:58:41.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"WFH vs Remote working & the WFH allowance analysis","permalink":"/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working"},"nextItem":{"title":"Understanding google data storage options in GCP","permalink":"/blog/Understanding-google-data-storage-options-in-GCP"}},"content":"![cache calls](./assets/cachecalls.webp)\\n\\nOne of the performance optimization techniques is to serve data from the cache and lookup for the network if the cache fails. It\'s called cache first then network strategy. Life moves fast and if the API has to get updated information, it\'s impossible because we are reading the cache always. Is there a way to bypass cache in this setup? Yes, it\'s cache-control headers.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## What is cache in programming & a little bit about related jargon\\n\\nThe cache is similar to duplicating a response to use serve the response when required. The cache may be used as-is or after validating for changes from the server.\\n\\nThe place where we store the cache is called `store`.\\n\\nCaching about the frontend can happen in the browser, on the server-side, or at the CDN level, we can have caches.\\n\\nThe cache is beneficial only when managed correctly, when it reaches a stage it\'s unmanageable then it will be a problem. A cache should serve the local data only as long as the data at the source has not changed otherwise the user might see old data.\\n\\nThere are 2 types of cache. The private cache is like a private car. To be used by one client. The other variant is the shared cache. The shared cache could be caching the home page on the server which will be served to multiple users.\\n\\n> HTTP caching is applicable for GET calls & it cannot be applied for other HTTP methods. the URL becomes the key in the cache\\n\\n## Cache-Control header? What\'s that?\\n\\nNow that we know the cache & its types. We need a control mechanism for the cache. Its provided by the `Cache-Control` header.\\n\\nBefore we take more about it, the reader should know what is a header. The header is present in both the request and the response. In the request, it\'s called the request header. On the response, it\'s called the response header. The request header can be modified by JS code in the browser.\\n\\n## How to bust browser GET calls cache?\\n\\nThe old school way is to ensure the GET call URL looks different or is different.\\n\\n1. In webpack we have the hashing of build files so that the URLs are reaching the server to get the new files after the new build.\\n\\n2. In `REST` get calls the query param is changed so that the browser thinks it\'s a new request and bypasses cache. For instance, using `Date.now()` as the query hash. The common versioning by API number is a commonly accepted syntax.\\n\\n> In the case of browser get calls we cannot do header change to do cache busting, we have to fallback to generate unique URLs.\\n\\n## How to cache bust API Calls generated from code?\\n\\nIf you use a package like `axios` or any other to generate GET calls, we have the API to generate request headers for the API calls dynamically.\\n\\nFor instance, we can set the header to cache bust when the user clicks on the `refresh` button else get the response from `cache`.\\n\\n## What are the header options to no cache?\\n\\n> Technically we want to instruct the browser not to store the GET call in the cache. We call it no-store\\n\\nWe can use `Cache-Control: no-store`. The request and the response will not be stored. If an existing cache exists, it will be ignored. If you have a request header with `no-cache`, the request is sent to the server and the full response will be downloaded.\\n\\n## What if we want to validate the cache with the server each time?\\n\\nWe want to serve fresh data as much as possible at the same time use cache if possible. So we use `no-cache`. Though it sounds confusing at first. `no-cache` is about checking correctness with the server before using the cache.\\n\\n> no-cache should technically be called cached but validate each time\\n\\n## How do I prevent a cache from stored in public caches\\n\\nWe can enforce rules to cache. For instance, I do not want my bank GET calls to be cached by my ISP. In that case, the developers need to use\\n\\n`Cache-Control: private`\\n\\nTo recap, private means cache for one user. Public means the request can be cached and served for multiple users.\\n\\n`Cache-Control: public`\\n\\n## What if I want my cache to expire in one day\\n\\nWe have `max-age` which takes time value in seconds. If you set the max-age to 3600 seconds. Then the cache is considered for one hour since the request has been initiated.\\n\\n`Cache-Control: max-age=3600`\\n\\n## What if I want my cache to be private, validated each time\\n\\nWe can separate the values for `Cache-Control` by a comma.\\n\\n`Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600`\\n\\n## What\'s the browser support\\n\\n`Cache-Control` was introduced in HTTP 1.1. For backward compatibility, we can use the `pragma` header.\\n\\n## Can we classify the data in the cache\\n\\nThe cache data can be classified as \\n\\n1. Fresh - means its relevant and data has not reached expiry date\\n\\n2. Stale - it\'s past the expiry date set by the max-age\\n\\n## How much cache can we store in the browser\\n\\nThere are a few things about cache\\n\\n- Cache is dependent on the resources\\n\\n- Not all of my cache will be stored on my browser forever. The cache works in LIFO format. Let\'s say I have a cache key that was not used for a long time. It might get dropped when there is a resource constraint. Technically we call it `cache eviction`.\\n\\n## How does this conditional validation of cache work\\n\\nWe can trigger a conditional request. Think of it like a ternary operator in JS.\\n\\n`const isIndian = hasAadharCard ? true : false; // lol`\\n\\nIn the above example, based on the `hasAadharCard` value. We are assigned a boolean to `isIndian`.\\n\\nIf the request header has an `If-None-Match` header, then we are triggering a special variant of HTTP call which will get\\n\\n- Full response downloaded when the data has changed on the server. This call is similar to the GET call getting a status code of 200. This change is based on a comparison of the `ETag` code.\\n\\n- No response when the data has not changed on the server. This call gets an empty response because the cache is going to be released in the place of response by the browser. The status code is `304`\\n\\nbehind the scenes, we send an extra header\\n\\n`If-none-match: \\"329772378483289832989328932893298ndo28938293\\"` the code is the `ETag` code which is sent as part of response header. ETag is like the version number for your cache. If the version number (etag code) matches, then the cache version is used\\n\\n> When the ETag codes are the same, then we can sure that the cached content is the same byte for byte so we can use the cache on the browser in place of response. That\'s why the server sends a 304 status code.\\n\\nSometimes browsers are smart enough to cache data and compare it with the server without the developer writing any code for caching functionality. But it\'s unreliable so it\'\\ns better to take better control by setting `Cache-Control` headers.\\n\\n## If header values are comma-separated, what\'s the precedence\\n\\nHere are a couple of things to know\\n\\n- Some combination of header values makes it invalid\\n\\n- If you have max-age and the value is valid. Let\'s say you set the cache age to 1 year. The data is considered fresh for a whole one year and the data validation does not occur. Unless you have `no-cache` mentioned.\\n\\n## Why does one prefer to use cache\\n\\n- It\'s for performance reasons. The benefits are manifold\\n\\n- If the server returns 304, then the transmission of data over wire is reduced. It\'s a performance gain.\\n\\n- If an asset is a cache for some time. The subsequent API calls are returned from disk instead of the server. That\'s a huge performance gain.\\n\\n- Caching content on the server can be served to multiple users. This is called the public cache."},{"id":"/Understanding-google-data-storage-options-in-GCP","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Understanding-google-data-storage-options-in-GCP","source":"@site/blog/Understanding-google-data-storage-options-in-GCP.md","title":"Understanding google data storage options in GCP","description":"google data storage","date":"2020-12-04T20:48:24.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"cloud-ops","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-ops"}],"readingTime":1.83,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Understanding google data storage options in GCP","tags":["cloud-ops"],"date":"2020-12-04T20:48:24.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Cache busting GET calls with cache-control headers","permalink":"/blog/Cache-busting-get-calls-with-cache-control-headers"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to refine your WFH etiquette","permalink":"/blog/How-to-refine-your-WFH-etiquette"}},"content":"![google data storage](./assets/googledatastorage.webp)\\n\\nAs a developer, the most confusing part of GCP are the storage options.

It means with no prior experience employees are expected to do something as part of a team. Here are 3 things which you should do as part of WFH etiquette.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n \\n## 1. It\'s about how others hear you\\n\\n> It does not matter if you are working from a beach or high floor apartment or your living room. Make sure your team members hear only your voice and nothing else from the background.\\n\\nMost of us have put a sticker on the webcam and the only way others perceive your professional behavior is with the computer audio. Here are a few things you should do\\n\\n1. Find a room where there are hardly any household noises or noises from the vehicles on the busy street. Honking is common in India so avoid rooms near the street.\\n\\n2. Find a good microphone to give your best audio during meetings.\\n\\n3. Invest in a good internet connection. A bad internet connection can lead to bad audio.\\n\\n## 2. Don\'t be an evening weirdo\\n\\n> Just because people are working from home, it does not mean that you can pull others into a meeting during odd hours.\\n\\nEmbrace asynchronous communication and get better at writing. Meetings demand everyone\'s time, but writing an email/chat to send information could be beneficial to the team.\\n\\nI believe we should stick to 9 am to 5 pm, especially in India where everyone works in the same time zone. It should be easy to follow.\\n\\nPulling team members into a meeting in the evening means they are going to miss their walk/exercise. Do not spoil the team culture and team members\' health.\\n\\n## 3. Stay accountable & get things done\\n\\nYou cannot blame the lack of office for your reduced productivity. Missing on a crucial defect could lead to a deferred release getting a bad rep for the whole team.\\n\\n### Fix the common issues & establish your process\\n\\nDon\'t repeat the same reasons like power cut, internet, etc. Just find an alternate or plan B.\\n\\n> Unreliable practices are a recipe to failure which your team members can notice. You should set up your own WFH rules or process.\\n\\nHave reliable practices like\\n\\n- Dedicated on and off for working time like old school 9 am to 5 pm\\n\\n- Ergonomic chair or whatever works for you. Don\'t let ergonomics eat into your casual leaves. You have one backbone.\\n\\n- Uninterrupted power supply to your internet router & laptop\\n\\n- Reliable internet connection is a must, you want to download `node modules` or docker images right \ud83d\ude03\\n\\n- Practice stress management and take care of your health. We are disconnected socially more than ever before.\\n\\n- Read books on remote working like the [book remote itself](https://basecamp.com/books/remote).\\n\\n## Beware: You could be on the surveillance\\n\\nEmployee surveillance software is real. Your org could know the hours you logged in, may capture screenshots, know about browsing history, or even record audio. Your employer might even know where you are working from, you know that GPS thing right.\\n\\nJust be professional all the time, even though you are away from work.\\n\\n[Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com/how-tracking-works) is one such surveillance software that I am aware of.

Ever since every project I worked on used some variant of scrum framework like agile, broken agile, pseudo agile, etc. There is a new kid in the block called [shape up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) which also talks about executing projects with a team. Here are some differences and similarities between scrum and shape-up.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What about the 4 main events in a sprint?\\n\\nBefore we talk about the 4 main events in a sprint, I want to emphasize that there is no concept of a sprint in shape-up. Instead, you pick up a chunk of work, hammer down the scope so that you can finish the frontend, backend within a fixed time of `6 weeks`.\\n\\nThe 6 weeks looks like a sprint but it\'s not because the team works on a new project/piece of functionality after 6 weeks leaving behind the past work. For long projects, we can have a cycle of work done in 6 weeks and keep the cycle going.\\n\\nIn agile sprints, we mostly work on the same projects and working on a different task.\\n\\nComing back to the question about 4 main events in a sprint. The 4 events are \\n\\n1. Sprint planning\\n\\n2. Standup meeting\\n\\n3. Sprint end meeting\\n\\n4. Retrospection meeting\\n\\nSprint planning is replaced by a full-fledged async planning session called shape-up meetings.\\n\\nStandup meeting does not exist in shape-up instead we have hill charts which show where the work is progressing.\\n\\nSprint end & retro meeting does not exist in shape-up.\\n\\n## What about the definition of done\\n\\nThe definition of done is the goal we want to hit in a sprint in the Scrum framework. It could be finishing a unit of work etc but in shape-up the done means `deploying` to the customers.\\n\\nDone definition in shape-up is apt because the 6 weeks was meant to finish the usable functionality.\\n\\n## What about work that does not get done in 6 weeks\\n\\nThat\'s interesting because scope creep is real in the normal world. In the shape-up world, the scope is hammered down. The team asks themselves about the value of the scope that\'s pending. If found indispensable, then the minimum viable product is built else the scope is dropped.\\n\\nThere is a concept of `circuit breaker` which means after 6 weeks no work on the same project will be done. This is also called `appetite`.\\n\\n## Does shape up has a manifesto, like agile\\n\\nI do not think so. The home page makes a ridicule of sprint calling it as going in circles. There are principles outlined in the shape-up book but they are mostly applicable on a per case basis. The principles are focused on product discovery and implementation keeping the balance between autocratic and slippery requirements.\\n\\nFor example, a mockup is set in stone. Most conversations will be about how to get it done. The senior management has likely given a nod for the mockup and the development team has less scope for their creativity.\\n\\n## We have rally / JIRA for agile, what about shape-up\\n\\nNo surprises here, it\'s a base-camp web & mobile app. FYI post-it notes won\'t work with shape up.\\n\\n## What are the problems which shape up seems to solve in contrast to scrum\\n\\nScrum comes with planning overhead. Every 2 weeks we have planning, sprint end meetings where we make decisions. The meetings translate to long meetings with the whole team. It means a loss in hours of productivity.\\n\\nThere are no slow down hours in the scrum. At one of my employers, the workload was kind of balanced and we were given slow down hours where we can do R&D, do bug fixes, etc. But in high-performance Scrum teams it\'s run, run & run while balancing user stories and defects.\\n\\n> Slow down hours is one concept I wish scrum teams adopt from shape-up quickly.\\n\\nWhen we know that there are some awful ideas, whacky ideas, and costly ideas to implement in a project. The scrum team treats almost all ideas equally by giving them a parking area called `backlog`. But in shape-up, there is no backlog which means if a feature is important then it will be brought back to discussions\\n\\n## What about team sizes and variants in the shape-up team?\\n\\nA shape-up team has a designer and 2 programmers. There is no mention of if the developers are a mix of backend/frontend or full-stack/mobile app dev.\\n\\nIn the Scrum teams, I worked we limit to 8 people with all disciplines.\\n\\n## What about scrum master role or other roles\\n\\nAs of now, there are no roles mentioned in the shape-up explicitly. There is a mention of a designer + experts requirement in some of the meetings.\\n\\nI am sure when the scaling of shape-up or shape-up adoption starts then the new roles might come up. \\n\\n## What about planning poker\\n\\nHaha, we have the betting table here at shape-up. The company makes a bet that they will be working on this project for the next 6 weeks. At this stage, the project is called a bet.\\n\\n## Is shape-up opinionated about documentation\\n\\nIn agile projects, the emphasis was on working prototypes over documentation. That does not mean any documentation. Many times I worked on projects which had nice word documents that were developed before the requirements were implemented. The project is that there was no standard structure of the documents generated by the team member. In shape-up, we have a nice structure. Its as follows\\n\\n1. Problem - idea/use case\\n\\n2. Appetite - how much time to spend on this\\n\\n3. Solution - core elements in an easy to understand the way\\n\\n4. Rabbit holes - risk management stuff\\n\\n5. No-gos - scope or functionality that are discovered but excluded so that later someone does not get excited about it.\\n\\n## What type of companies will best benefit from this \\n\\nThe minimalist companies will benefit from this. The cost center projects will benefit from this because they would be able to save money and avoid running over the deadlines.\\n\\nFor services companies, it\'s tough because there is a risk of work not getting extended after 6 weeks unless the team follows 6-week cycles.\\n\\n> Shape-up is best when the experts do the project shaping up correctly and hand over the work to the best men/women freelancers who would get things done in 6 weeks.\\n\\nFor product teams, 6 weeks is an ideal time to ship something meaningful out of the door. This is something I want scrum teams to adopt. I have hardly seen any meaningful unit of work done in 2 weeks cycle.\\n\\nI would not give 9 months of work to a freelancer. In all likelihood that work will never get delivered.\\n\\n## Any good news for developers in shape-up\\n\\nI would not call it good news but a difference in approach mentioned in shape-up\\n\\n- The 6 weeks\' time is guarded against defect fixes. That means lesser distraction. I am still skeptical about distraction because the production issues can creep in.\\n\\n- The code review approvals are not a must, in fact, the seniors will look at them when they got the time or want to take a break.\\n\\n- There is no mention of a QA member in the shape-up team, it means that the dev team is responsible for the quality.\\n\\nMore information can be found at [Shape up book](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook)."},{"id":"/How-to-give-a-talk-about-a-book-in-front-of-people-aka-book-talk","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/How-to-give-a-talk-about-a-book-in-front-of-people-aka-book-talk","source":"@site/blog/How-to-give-a-talk-about-a-book-in-front-of-people-aka-book-talk.md","title":"How to give a talk about a tech book in front of people","description":"Some alt text","date":"2020-11-28T23:23:51.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-books","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-books"}],"readingTime":4.52,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to give a talk about a tech book in front of people","tags":["tech-books"],"date":"2020-11-28T23:23:51.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Comparing scrum vs shape-up as a developer","permalink":"/blog/Comparing-scrum-vs-shape-up-as-a-developer"},"nextItem":{"title":"GCP Fundamentals core infrastructure course on Coursera","permalink":"/blog/GCP-Fundamentals-course-on-coursera"}},"content":"![Some alt text](./assets/book-talk.webp)\\n\\nAs a passionate reader, I find myself describing the book in brief passionately to my friends. I went on to give multiple book talks in the library. In this post, I put a checklist on the steps to prepare and deliver wonderful book talks at library/community events or on Youtube.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n \\n## What is a book-talk\\n\\nBook-talk is a form of public speaking where the speaker talks about a book to persuade the audience to read the book. \\n\\n> Book talk is a way to push a book on the audience to-read list with the help of a short speech. \ud83d\ude03\\n \\n## What is the prerequisite for talking in public?\\n\\nPeople naturally listen to you if you have a status in the society, a leadership role or if you have specialized knowledge like a scientist or sportsperson. A vast majority of us do not fall into the above category but we are not left out. \\n\\n> We may be passionate about a topic and want to tell the world. That\'s the starting point in public speaking. The passion gives you the charisma, content, the guts to talk in front of people and confront the defiant.\\n\\nPassion towards your idea is the prerequisite. Then comes the platform (could be TED/Youtube/Blog/Public gathering) and your communication style.\\n\\n## How is book-talk different from the book summary\\n\\nBook summary came into existence because many people believe that the facts/bullet points are important than the style of the author, the narrative, the case studies, and the flow of content in the book. One person reads the books, highlights the points which he felt were important, and circulates it around as a book summary with some description around the key points.\\n\\nBook talks are different from book summaries because the goal is different. Book talks are delivered to persuade the people to read the book rather than showering the highlights of the book. To persuade the audience, we include some persuasion techniques like storytelling, social proof, etc. The book talk is a success when the audience read the book themselves.\\n\\n## How to give a killer book-talk\\n\\nHere is my 10 point checklist, better follow in the same order\\n\\n1. Pick a book you are passionate about and fix a date to give the talk\\n\\n2. Start with 3 simple questions that relate to the audience. This is a hook to bring audiences into your world from theirs.\\n\\n3. Describe why you think the author had written the book, is a part of any book series\\n\\n4. Talk about the author and his work\\n\\n5. Talk about how this book can impact your carrier. Will it help you realize your dream\\n\\n6. Comment on the language used, are there any illustrations or charts that could fascinate the audience\\n\\n7. Is it a light/heavy read, can every give it a read. Describe your reading experience\\n\\n8. Talk about one touching story from the book\\n\\n9. Give some insights about the book ratings online, the price, and where they can buy/lend the book. Give your rating out of 5.\\n\\n10. Conclude with a fantastic stanza or concept from the book. This should be the takeaway for the audience.\\n\\n## What could be the ideal duration of a book-talk\\n\\nA book talk\'s effectiveness is important than the duration. Having said that, my ideal duration would be 20 minutes with 10 minutes to interact with the audience.\\n\\nIf it\'s a fiction book, the book talk could be revealing the plot so keep it under 10 minutes.\\n\\n## Are there any legal issues involved.\\n\\nI am not a legal geek so here is my take. We are helping get more people to read/buy the book. We did not claim the works to be ours, nor deriving profits like book-summary services.\\n\\nWith a book talk we are striving for a win-win for the publisher and readers.\\n\\n## Where can you give a book talk\\n\\nStart by talking at the local library. you may have very few audiences which are fine so that you can perform and practice along.\\n\\nIf there is no library then make videos and upload them on youtube. Don\'t forget to promote the video to the right audience so that they discover your book talk.\\n\\n## How can I defeat the fear of public speaking\\n\\nAre you passionate about the book and want more people to read the book, then make a book talk and deliver it. Let your passion be the force that defeats the fear of public speaking.\\n\\n## How to avoid controversy during the speech\\n\\nAvoid topics which could trigger emotions like\\n\\n1. Sexual topics / discussing erotica\\n\\n2. Comparing religions / quoting and vilifying people from a religion\\n\\n3. Avoid praising politicians or otherwise\\n\\nThe above 3 are followed extensively at toastmasters international so it could work for you.\\n\\nAdding to above 3, \\n\\n- do not volunteer to give health tip because it may not work as expected for everyone in the room\\n \\n- discuss or promote illegal practices just to look cool\\n \\n- Most importantly be ready to say sorry if you said something by mistake or offended anyone.\\n\\n## I do not want to do public speaking but want to do a book -talk\\n\\nOk, you can write a blog post about your favorite book. I have done that and it does the job.

Here is a quick recap of the good parts and the learning from the course.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n## Wait you read books to learn things but why online course?\\n\\nThe times have changed. Earlier we used to get technical books from the real physical library, then came digital library, and now it\'s online courses. For cloud concepts, I would recommend online courses but if you are learning concepts like terminal commands or JAVA basics then a book would do. Cloud UI keeps changing and I noticed minor updates to the UI from the time the online course was recorded. Updating a course is easier than updating a paperback book.\\n\\n> Better adapt or perish\\n\\nSo I took up an online course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course format is easy to learn. For instance, we have\\n\\n- Goal-based learning. For instance, a set of lectures are tagged to a timeline.\\n\\n- Proper course introduction and review lecture\\n\\n- Concepts + demonstrations\\n\\n- Lab sessions with time + resources allocated\\n\\n- Quiz to check our knowledge\\n\\n- A sharable certificate\\n\\n## Why is this course important?\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, we need to get started with a cloud platform but how to do it? We have to begin with the fundamentals. This course is all about fundamentals.\\n\\nFor instance, I had no idea/clue about product offerings like\\n\\n- Google compute engine\\n\\n- Google Kubernetes engine\\n\\n- Google app engine\\n\\nBut towards the end of the course, I can describe these products, talk about the differences, and do a hello world program too.\\n\\n## What next after this course?\\n\\nOnce the fundamental course is complete, we need to choose the specialization track like\\n\\n- Cloud application developer\\n\\n- Cloud application architect\\n\\n- Cloud SRE and OPS etc\\n\\nThe specialization courses are much bigger than this 12-hour course\\n\\n## What are the various things you learnt\\n\\n1. For every task you can perform with the UI, there is an alternate `gcp` command.\\n\\n2. You need to understand terms like IAAS, PAAS, SAAS and be able to relate to the google cloud concepts\\n\\n3. You will learn about spinning virtual machines that are tied to a project. The billing is done on the project.\\n\\n4. various IAM roles can be configured on the project\\n\\n5. Kubernetes engine is the sweet spot for companies to manage & deploy their apps. You do not have to worry about load balancing, scaling up/down, application crashes, and restarts when configured correctly.\\n\\n6. App engine is a hands-off approach where the code is tied to the platform APIs\\n\\n7. The networking concepts and OS concepts are important. If you have never installed an OS or set up a VM before, you will be puzzled with the choices of boot disks, hard disks, CPU configurations, etc to create a VM.\\n\\n8. The data storage products at GCP are exhaustive and are tailored to specific needs like cloud SQL, cloud datastore, etc. From transactional security to storing streaming data/blobs, there is a product that does its job and also scales easily.\\n\\n9. The debugging and stats are provided by stack driver which is a separate product which carries a charge to use it\\n\\n10. Big data & ML related services were introduced in the course at a very high level.\\n\\n## Were the labs sufficient\\n\\nAs a developer, we need to understand that the cloud services on GCP are billed/charged to a product. There is no free lunch here. The course gives access to qwik labs which give you step by step instructions to go about the course. Something like the lab manual at my college. The hard part is the time associated with the labs. If I were to type every command and read more about it, then the time would not be sufficient.\\n\\n## Was the quiz hard/easy?\\n\\nIf you read every line of the lab instructions and understand the concept, the quiz is easy to pass.\\n\\nYou get a boolean type of question where 1 of the 2 options is correct. There is another category where you have to select 3 correct options out of the 5.\\n\\nThe passing percentage is not jacked too high. It\'s mostly around 50 - 60% and you can take multiple attempts per day.\\n\\n\\n## Was the course interesting throughout\\n\\nIt will keep you hooked. The instructors are clear and the fundamentals are interesting to explore. \\n\\n## What are the things you need to know outside of the course to understand it better.\\n\\nOf course, things change too fast. It\'s better to read the documentation on the google cloud website to understand things better and stay on top of it.\\n\\nCloud concepts are easy to understand and tough to program, the commands related to GCP were not explained clearly. There is an assumption that you are aware of most Linux commands, editing in `vim/nano` etc. I did not know what `sed` editor was, I quickly read about `sed` command on the internet. There is much such networking, OS related concepts, app packing with dockers, etc which we may not be familiar with.\\n\\nIn short, this course discusses concepts at a high level and made certain assumptions about the learner. It\'s the job of the learner to patch up the knowledge gaps."},{"id":"/10-ways-in-which-Java-programs-differs-from-Javascript","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/10-ways-in-which-Java-programs-differs-from-Javascript","source":"@site/blog/10-ways-in-which-Java-programs-differs-from-Javascript.md","title":"10 ways in which Java programs differs from Javascript","description":"Java program","date":"2020-11-20T21:55:16.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"backend","permalink":"/blog/tags/backend"}],"readingTime":2.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"10 ways in which Java programs differs from Javascript","tags":["backend"],"date":"2020-11-20T21:55:16.000Z","authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"GCP Fundamentals core infrastructure course on Coursera","permalink":"/blog/GCP-Fundamentals-course-on-coursera"},"nextItem":{"title":"Backing up amazon kindle books & understanding DRM","permalink":"/blog/Backing-up-amazon-kindle-books-breaking-DRM"}},"content":"![Java program](./assets/Javaprogram.webp)\\n\\nThis is a fun post in which I collect 10 semantic differences between Java programs and Javascript programs. Here we go\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n \\n## 1. There is no global scope for variables or functions in Java\\n\\nIn Javascript basic programs, it\'s very common to ignore the scope and directly set variables & methods on the global scope. In Java, we cannot notice dangling global variables or methods. The variables and methods are scoped within the class and there is a methodology to access the variables or methods even if they are public scope. In javascript, the global variables are invoked by their names without the need to reference the `window` object.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Semicolons are mandatory in Java\\n\\nI can write Javascript without semicolons but in Java it\'s mandatory. It\'s interesting to note that the Java code will throw a compile-time error when there is a missing semicolon. In javascript, we can set up eslint to check if every statement ends with a semicolon.\\n\\n## 3. Single quotes have a different meaning in Java\\n\\nSingle quotes are reserved for `char` data type. Double quotes are used for `String` data type. In Javascript, we can use a single quote and double quote interchangeably based on developer / eslint preference.\\n\\n## 4. There is no variable hoisting in Java\\n\\nWe have a variety of variables in Java-like class, block, instance, static. These variable types have one thing in common. These types of variables are a classification of when a variable is created and destroyed in our program. By default, Java variables fall into one of the 4 variable classifications. No more global variables like JS.\\n\\n## 5. Typecasting, widening is an important Java concept\\n\\nBy virtue of static typecasting, the variables in our Java program cannot be mutated to another datatype within the code. Such code leads to compile-time errors. For instance, we cannot assign an integer to a string variable. Widening of Java variables needs no extra attention from the developer but narrowing needs typecasting. In JS we are free to play around with variables as they are dynamically typed. But dynamic typing is seen as a limitation and programming languages like Typescript offer to rescue JS limitations in large scale apps.\\n\\n## 6. Checking Java version\\n\\n`java -version`\\n\\nFor nodeJS, we use `node --version`\\n\\nOther differences to be updated soon.\\n\\nOf course, there are many more differences. For instance, we have the concept of higher-order components in JS but in Java it\'s a big deal."},{"id":"/Backing-up-amazon-kindle-books-breaking-DRM","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Backing-up-amazon-kindle-books-breaking-DRM","source":"@site/blog/Backing-up-amazon-kindle-books-breaking-DRM.md","title":"Backing up amazon kindle books & understanding DRM","description":"Amazon kindle books","date":"2020-11-20T08:24:51.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-books","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-books"}],"readingTime":2.59,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Backing up amazon kindle books & understanding DRM","date":"2020-11-20T08:24:51.000Z","tags":["tech-books"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"10 ways in which Java programs differs from Javascript","permalink":"/blog/10-ways-in-which-Java-programs-differs-from-Javascript"},"nextItem":{"title":"Must know terminal commands before touching production servers","permalink":"/blog/Must-know-terminal-commands-before-touching-production-servers"}},"content":"![Amazon kindle books](./assets/Amazonkindleebooks.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is amazon kindle & how it stores ebooks\\r\\n\\r\\nKindle is an ebook reading device with a browser and other capabilities. The kindle differs from tablets in one thing, i.e. the screen of the kindle is easy on your eyes so you can read for long hours without straining your eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can download books to kindle and they are available offline. The download happens through 2 modes.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Through wifi, direct download to kindle\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Through USB transfer, the book can be downloaded from the amazon site and sideloaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazon has its ebook format (AWZ3) in which the book gets downloaded to the device and is locked with DRM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## How is ebook different from PDF books\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are from web development, there is a concept of responsive web development in which the screen adapts itself to the screen width. IF we port the RWD concept to books, it becomes ebooks. The content is dynamically adjusted for screen width, font size, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adaptive nature cannot be found in PDF books. The page numbers and the contents are fixed and cannot be changed as per device requirements which makes reading a hassle on kindle. So do not sideload PDF books.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\'s why in the reading world, other ebook formats are popular like epub, Mobi etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Whats the deal with AWZ3 and DRM?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s say you download an ebook from the manage content and devices page on amazon, you cannot share it with your friend. You cannot read the book on your PC either. The book you download is locked to the kindle device or app preventing the sharing of books. It\'s similar to protecting a zip file with a password.\\r\\n\\r\\nDRM stands for Digital Rights Management. Its a technique employed to protect digital assets from unauthorized access and use. In the simplest form, it\'s an encryption technique. In the case of Kindle, the book is encrypted with the kindle serial number so you can read only on the particular kindle device.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why should we backup books from a kindle?\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to backup kindle books so that I can keep them in my personal ebooks folder. You may have your reasons too.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to backup from a kindle?\\r\\n\\r\\nI prefer downloading the book from the amazon manage content and devices page. That way we can bypass the detective job of finding where and how the books are organized in kindle storage. Read more about it on an article from PCMag.\\r\\n\\r\\n## DRM locks it from reading, then what next?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, we need to break the DRM by using online tools. Then you can preserve the book in your ebook folder on PC.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you use the online converter, make sure you have the kindle serial number handy.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Is it legal and illegal?\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe it\'s illegal and you should not mess with DRM books. As a geek, this article is to educate you on the possibilities and to understand tech like DRM. The very first professional assignment of mine had some work related to DRM (Digital Rights Management). I appreciate this technology."},{"id":"/Must-know-terminal-commands-before-touching-production-servers","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Must-know-terminal-commands-before-touching-production-servers","source":"@site/blog/Must-know-terminal-commands-before-touching-production-servers.md","title":"Must know terminal commands before touching production servers","description":"ls command","date":"2020-11-15T13:25:08.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"software-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-tools"}],"readingTime":6.9,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Must know terminal commands before touching production servers","date":"2020-11-15T13:25:08.000Z","tags":["software-tools"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Backing up amazon kindle books & understanding DRM","permalink":"/blog/Backing-up-amazon-kindle-books-breaking-DRM"},"nextItem":{"title":"Publishing my first npm package","permalink":"/blog/Publishing-my-first-npm-package"}},"content":"![ls command](./assets/ls-command.webp)\\n \\n I use windows 10 on a day to day basis. My colleagues and friends use windows too. The problem starts when the GUI disappears and we just have `SSH` access to the production boxes. On a production machine, running one wrong Unix/Linux command could risk your job. Here I am compiling the must know Unix/Linux commands keeping in mind the deployment and operations related tasks. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n \\n\\n## 1. What is the terminal about\\n \\n The Terminal is a fancy name for `command prompt` in Unix/Linux versions. The terminal allows you to enter a command to interact with the operating system. When you ssh into another machine, the terminal can be used as an interface to work with other OS. When you get on a terminal, check where your commands are going to run especially when working with higher development environments like Cert, Prod.\\n \\n## 2. How to practice Linux commands on Windows 10.\\n \\n There are multiple ways to run Linux commands on Windows 10 depending on if you have a home or pro license. Here is my approach as I have windows 10 pro\\n \\n - Install ubuntu on the hypervisor\\n - SSH to the guest OS would have been cool, if you do not want to SSH then use the terminal inside the VM.\\n - I did an SSH from windows Powershell. `ssh username@IPAddressOfVM`. Powershell because of the color of the shell and it gives color to the text which is easy to read. Putty does not show colors but it can be useful to save the host etc.\\n - To get IP address, use `ifconfig` or in GUI. `sudo apt-get install net-tools` to install `ifconfig` package.\\n \\n > For setting up [SSH with Hyper V](https://superuser.com/questions/1445288/port-forwarding-with-hyper-v-virual-machine-on-windows-10#:~:text=To%20set%20up%20an%20external,Click%20OK.). SSH would not work with the default switch.\\n \\n## 3. What are the basic CRUD commands\\n \\n     1. Create a file `touch hello.txt`\\n     2. Edit a file `cat hello.txt`\\n     3. Update a file\\n        - You can use editors like `vim` or `nano` or whatever is available\\n        - In all likely hood you will have `vim` editor so use `vi` commands\\n     4. Delete a file `rm hello.txt`\\n     5. Rename a file  `mv hello.txt helloOld.txt`\\n     6. Copy a file `cp hello.txt folderName/`\\n \\n## 4. How about commands to handle folders\\n \\n     1. Create a folder `mkdir nameOfFolder`\\n     2. Change directory\\n        - level above  `cd ..`\\n        - level below `cd folderName`\\n     3. Remove folder  `rmdir folderName`. If folder has contents, use `rm -r folderName`\\n     4. Move folder (also used for renaming folder) `mv -r foldername path`\\n     5. Copy folder `cp -r folderName path`\\n \\n## 5. Are there any specific commands which advanced developers use\\n \\n I would call these commands as slightly esoteric as only a few will use them.\\n  \\n  1. to see the last few lines of the log file as and when they get updated. `tail -f someFile.log`\\n  \\n  2. to check the permissions of the file on the server along with the most recently updated file at the bottom. `ls -ltr`\\n  \\n  3. List all the files recursively in a folder. `ls -R`\\n  \\n  4. Change permissions for users, users of a group, etc. Here is a good link having clear details about [Chmod](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions) command. \\n  \\n the first 3 chars represent permission for the group, the next for users of the group and the last 3 is for everyone else.\\n  \\n  To change use `chmod 664 fileName/folderName`\\n  \\n  5. Set environment variables `export MODE=PROD` & to retrieve `$MODE`. To see the mode use `echo $MODE`.\\n  \\n  6. To see file sizes in human-readable format use option `-h`, like `ls -lth`.\\n  \\n  7. Using wildcard char to filter out files in the selection, like `*`\\n  \\n  8. Using symbolic links\\n  \\n  9. Watching the resource utility on the VM instances with `top`.\\n  \\n  10. Clearing old log files if they are in the same box.\\n  \\n  11. Bouncing applications when they have errored or misbehaving.\\n  \\n## 6. Are there any interesting keyboard shortcuts to know?\\n  \\n  Let\'s say we have a long command & it\'s hard to navigate.\\n  \\n  `ctrl + a` takes you to the beginning of the command\\n  `ctrl + e` takes you to the end of the command\\n  `up / down` arrow will take you to previously typed commands\\n  `tab` key will autocomplete the path\\n  \\n  > If the file or folder name had space, wrap it with double-quotes.\\n  \\n  \\n## 7. Are there any reserved words worth remembering?\\n  \\n  Yeah, we have a few of them. The noteworthy is the `~` which takes you to the root dir. The others are\\n  \\n  - echo\\n  - pwd \\n  \\n## 8. What are these symbolic links\\n  \\n  They are similar to `windows shortcuts`. They are pointers to other files. They are created by `ln `. The link files are treated like any other files. They can be renamed, deleted, etc.\\n  \\n  They have many use-cases like you can skip copying a bulky folder by referencing it with a symbolic link.\\n  \\n \\n## 9. What about the find files command.\\n  \\n  It\'s a powerful command that is used to filter files, directories, fileTypes, files recursively.\\n  \\n  `find [Directory] [fileType/Name] NameOrPatternToBeSearched`\\n  \\n  example, `find . -name \'hello.txt\'` -- finds hello.txt in the same folder\\n  \\n  You can chain conditions with `-or`, `-and`.\\n  \\n## 10. What about file content search\\n  \\n  We use the `grep` command. Grep takes in options followed by the pattern we need to search.\\n  \\n  `grep \\"Hey\\" *\\"`\\n  \\n  To open the result file in nano editor use `nano \\"$(grep -ilr \\"Hey\\" * | head -1)\\"`\\n  \\n## 11. How do I set execute permission only to the owner\\n  \\n  `chmod u+x fileName` -- u for the user, g for group, o for others, a for all. You can chain permissions like `+rwx` or give numbers like `chmod 777 a.txt`\\n  \\n  More fine-grained access can be given like `chmod u=rwx, g=rw, o= file.txt`\\n  \\n## 12. Is learning vim editor necessary\\n  \\n  I have seen developers who are accustomed to `git gui` that they cannot use git outside of it. I have some dependency on the IntelliJ idea for resolving conflicts. The problem is that I do not get IntelliJ on prod servers so I have to fall back to git commands. So is life without learning vim? There is an assumption that vim is installed on UNIX/Linux servers universally. There is no guarantee that nano is present on prod servers. So better learn vim.\\n  \\n  Actually, to get the ball rolling you need to \\n  \\n  1. Know about reading & insert mode\\n  2. Save file & discard the changes\\n  3. Scrolling through & jumping to the beginning, end of line\\n  4. Searching for keywords, replacing text\\n  \\n## 13. Whats this PIPE operator\\n  \\n  as the word says, it\'s an operator that takes the output of the first statement and gives it as input to the second.\\n  \\n## 14. How to find the process which is taking the most CPU\\n  \\n  We can use the `top` command and order the CPU column. `top -o CPU`. You can see the top process of the user by `ps -cvx` and further narrow it down with grep `ps -cvx | grep firefox`.\\n  \\n## 15. How do you terminate a process?\\n  \\n  Managing processes happen through signals. We can use the term or `kill` command. `kill $PID` will kill the application. The process id will change after the restart of the same app so do not cache the ID or store it in a variable.\\n  \\n## 16. How do you create your own command to do a bunch of stuff\\n  \\n  Basically, we need to create a method in the bash profile and invoke it.\\n  \\n## 17. How to set alias & invoke it\\n  \\n  `alias myAlias=\\"ll -ltr\\"`. Call the alias with myAlias after restarting or sourcing the bash profile.\\n \\n## 18. How to know if your password is expiring soon in Linux\\n  \\n  The password management policies are quite strict on production machines so remember to change the password periodically or someday it might get locked. To know the expiry date of your password and other details, type\\n\\n  `chage -l $(whoami)`\\n        \\n  To change the password, you must know your existing password. If you do not know your password then its better you raise a ticket to reset the password.\\n        \\n  `passwd $(whoami)`\\n  \\n## Switch user account in unix/linux\\n\\n  Due to permission issues you will be expected to switch to another functional account. In that case do\\n    \\n   `su - username` and enter the password associated with the username. Verify by executing `whoami`"},{"id":"/Publishing-my-first-npm-package","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Publishing-my-first-npm-package","source":"@site/blog/Publishing-my-first-npm-package.md","title":"Publishing my first npm package","description":"starting my first npm package","date":"2020-11-05T20:04:14.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":2.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Publishing my first npm package","date":"2020-11-05T20:04:14.000Z","tags":["frontend"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Must know terminal commands before touching production servers","permalink":"/blog/Must-know-terminal-commands-before-touching-production-servers"},"nextItem":{"title":"OWASP top 9 & 10 vulnerabilities discussed with simple examples","permalink":"/blog/OWASP-top-10-discussed"}},"content":"![starting my first npm package](./assets/start-npm-package.webp)\\n\\nHow does anyone know if their customer got any JS errors/application crashes? How does the operations team know about the crash before the customer screams on email/social media? Finding an answer to this question led to the building of my first `npm` package. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n\\n## What is the motivation behind this npm package\\n\\nEvery front-end app needs error reporting and monitoring.\\n\\nError reporting means, the application errors need to be sent to the developer for analysis and fixes. The next step is the monitoring for which you can run some cron job etc.\\n\\nMost JS frameworks/libs do not have support for error reporting to the service. Things like Reach error boundaries can stop the app from the complete crash but how will the developer sitting elsewhere know about the crash that happened to the end-user? This is a gap which this npm package tries to solve\\n\\n\\n## What about amazing tools out there?\\n\\nThere could be amazing tools like sentry etc but they are cloud-based. If you are working in a company, you need manager approval, and it\'s a paid app. The manager will hate you because of its difficult times.\\n\\nMoreover, we have to analyze the data policy. Some people think open source is free which is not true, the developer\'s time costs money. So setting up an open-source sentry is not an option at all.\\n\\n## Was deploying to npm easy\\n\\nDeploying to npm is easy but deploying the right is hard without `npm`.\\n\\n1. Scaffold the npm package with `npm init`\\n\\n2. create a JS module with `module.exports`\\n\\n3. The functionality can depend on other packages as well.\\n\\n4. Meanwhile get the login access at npmjs, set it up on the local machine & `npm deploy`\\n\\n5. The source code can be exposed to Github. So push it to a repo on GitHub.\\n\\n6. But you see the code and node versions are not tagged. so we need to use `npm`\\n\\n## what is this npm package about \\n\\nnp is a CLI utility that ensures you follow all the best practices when you do an npm publish.\\n\\npublish can be hard because you need to take care of `server` & tag the version on git.\\n\\nAll of this is taken care of by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np). It\'s free to use.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nThere are useful metrics we can collect from the site of error. It could be `navigator` object information and much more.\\n\\nThe immediate step is to fixate on the information that will be collected & reported.\\n\\nThe collected information needs to be easily clubbed up with tools like `SPLUNK` for monitoring.\\n\\nOf course, there is a lot of work to do.\\n\\n## Anything else\\n\\nAfter a long time, I got to write some code outside of `React`.

Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### Are they talking about React components or web components here?\\n\\nReact/Web components could be a part of the set of components that OWASP talks about. But let\'s understand it this way.\\n\\nNo system is carved out from a single monolith codebase. We have components/software packages/applications that interact with each other. Right now, I am writing this blog on IntelliJ running on Windows 10. If IntelliJ or windows 10 has a security loophole, then my blog post drafts can be compromised and leaked before I publish.\\n\\nThe unit of software is what they call a `Component`.\\n\\n### Are there any simple examples of web devs to understand.\\n\\nWordPress is an amazing CMS that powers several million websites but there are many plugins for WordPress which become a compromised component leading to the website getting hacked.\\n\\nThe component could be a framework, operating system, or anything.\\n\\n### What should you do to prevent component with vulnerabilities?\\n\\nIts obvious, you should not have components with vulnerabilities. For that it always helps to automate the scan for components with vulnerabilities. When a component is known to have a risk, we need to patch the software.\\n\\n### What about hardware components\\n\\nThe hard truth is that some IOT devices have hardware-level vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed. We have to stop using them.\\n\\n# 10. Insufficient Application Logs and Monitoring of logs\\n\\n### What is logging & monitoring in this context\\n\\nLet us understand logging and monitoring in short.\\n\\n**Logging** - logging is a task in which application messages are written to a `logfile`. The messages can be given by developers and their recording mechanism can be controlled.\\n\\n**Monitoring** - monitoring is a task in which we analyze and alert the observers when a certain pattern/event has been found. The monitoring can be configured on the logs.\\n\\n### Logging & Developers\\n\\nAs a developer, we implement application logging on the server-side. These logs have various levels like \\n\\n- Info\\n\\n- Error\\n\\n- Warnings\\n\\n- Fatal\\n\\n- Trace etc\\n\\nOther examples of bad logs are\\n\\n1. There were cases where the passwords entered by users were wrongly logged to files. This is a serious security risk.\\n\\n2. Recording of events is not sufficient. For instance, if you are not logging all the transactions for whatever reasons. In some scenarios, the logs are misleading or confusing. The developer might have copy-pasted the log statement in a hurry. There is hardly any QA looking at the logs.\\n\\n3. The logs are stored locally. In this case, the hacker can delete the log file.\\n\\n### where do things go wrong?\\n\\nThere are 3 scenarios where things can go wrong\\n\\n1. Insufficient logging/logs not getting captured. Logs have crucial information about application usage and health. When there are no logs, there is no way we can know if the system is working as expected or compromised. This is what we call **Insufficient logging**. Opposite of insufficient logging can trigger excess alerts which the ops team might find hard to manage.\\n\\n2. Insufficient/No monitoring but only logging - This is a common case in my opinion. The logs are filling up hard disks but there is hardly any system in place to monitor the logs. Even if there were a system to monitor logs, it may not be scanning the logs for security breaches. \\n\\n3. Logs stored locally are no good. The hacker can get away by tampering with the logs before the monitoring or forensics happen.\\n\\n> Logs when analyzed can give information upon which we can take timely action.\\n\\nUnmonitored logs help the hackers to exploit the system easily. It\'s like a bank without a guard at the door."},{"id":"/Summary-of-a-course-on-EBook-formatting","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Summary-of-a-course-on-EBook-formatting","source":"@site/blog/Summary-of-a-course-on-EBook-formatting.md","title":"Summary of a course on EBook formatting","description":"Ebooks and books","date":"2020-10-31T22:27:17.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-books","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-books"}],"readingTime":1.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Summary of a course on EBook formatting","date":"2020-10-31T22:27:17.000Z","tags":["tech-books"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"OWASP top 9 & 10 vulnerabilities discussed with simple examples","permalink":"/blog/OWASP-top-10-discussed"},"nextItem":{"title":"Chrome Lighthouse with dhbalaji.dev as site under study, with fixes","permalink":"/blog/Chrome-Lighthouse-on-dhbalaji-dev-with-fixes"}},"content":"![Ebooks and books](./assets/Ebooks-and-books.webp)\\n\\nHi, no bonus points for guessing that I intend to write an e-book. I took a course to gain skills in ebook formatting. Here is the summary of the course in Q&A format.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n\\n## How is formatting an e-book different from a real book.\\n\\nHere are a couple of key differences between formatting an ebook vs a normal book.\\n\\n1. A normal book can have a fixed layout because the content is laid out on paper and the size of the paper remains the same. In the case of an e-book, the user screen width and font settings decide the layout\\n\\n2. Page numbers play a role in identifying content in a book but page numbers do not exist in the world of e-books. They might be given by the app but they are irrelevant most of the time. One page on a paperback book can be 4 pages on a kindle.\\n\\n3. PDF books are similar to paperback books but PDF books are not welcome everywhere. Some ebook stores expect .epub, .mobi etc. The formatting needs to be done keeping in mind the dynamic nature of the ecosystem.\\n\\n## What are the must-have components of the ebook.\\n\\nYes, components like head, header, footer, body, main, section, etc.. Well, these are components in the HTML world. In ebooks, we have the below ones\\n\\n- Cover page\\n\\n- Disclaimer\\n\\n- Table of contents\\n\\n- Chapters\\n\\n- Subheadings of chapters\\n\\n- Cross-selling your other materials towards the end of the book\\n\\n## Tools that help us with formatting\\n\\nTo keep it simple we need \\n\\n- Word editor like MS Word or Google Docs\\n\\n- Need to have cloud sync capabilities so you do not lose your work in a PC crash or mobile theft.\\n\\n\\n## How do verify that your formatting works\\n\\nThis is my answer because the course did not talk about this question. To begin with, no one ebook format fits all. The output folder need to have\\n\\n- PDF\\n- Mobi\\n- Epub\\n\\n## What is out of scope while formatting an ebook\\n\\nThis is my answer because the course did not talk about this question. Grammar check is out of scope because the formatting is about presenting content in a way it works. Maybe it works for a publishing house or more."},{"id":"/Chrome-Lighthouse-on-dhbalaji-dev-with-fixes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Chrome-Lighthouse-on-dhbalaji-dev-with-fixes","source":"@site/blog/Chrome-Lighthouse-on-dhbalaji-dev-with-fixes.md","title":"Chrome Lighthouse with dhbalaji.dev as site under study, with fixes","description":"Chrome Lighthouse","date":"2020-10-28T22:38:23.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"software-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-tools"}],"readingTime":2.35,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Chrome Lighthouse with dhbalaji.dev as site under study, with fixes","date":"2020-10-28T22:38:23.000Z","tags":["software-tools"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Summary of a course on EBook formatting","permalink":"/blog/Summary-of-a-course-on-EBook-formatting"},"nextItem":{"title":"A developer review of Amazon Prime Reading, what works & what doesn\'t","permalink":"/blog/A-developers-review-of-Amazon-Prime-Reading-what-works-what-doesn-t"}},"content":"![Chrome Lighthouse](./assets/ChromeLighthouse.webp)\\n\\n## Introduction to Google Chrome Lighthouse\\n\\n> Version being discussed here -- Lighthouse 6.2.0\\n\\n* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) is an automation tool to audit the quality of web pages.\\n\\n* Lighthouse can help you monitor a bunch of metrics on mobile & desktop-like\\n    * Performance\\n    * Accessibility\\n    * Best practices\\n    * SEO\\n    * PWA etc\\n    \\n* Lighthouse is to be baked into the tooling pipeline so that your app quality is monitored on a regular basis.\\n\\n* There are 2 variants of Lighthouse.

The hexo theme uses `font-awesome` which needs to be downloaded before the text could be shown. This is a **performance issue**.\\n \\n This can be solved by adding `font-display: swap` in the @font-face CSS declaration.\\n \\n More information can be found on [web.dev](https://web.dev/font-display/). There is a problem with this fix. There is a chance of another issue which is termed `Flash of Unstyled Text`. This calls for a regression issue. The fix for the flash of unstyled text (FOUT) is to `preload` the fonts so that the render is not delayed by the critical request chain.\\n \\n <pre>\\n    <link rel=\\"preload\\" href=\\"/css/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff\\" as=\\"font\\" type=\\"font/woff\\" crossorigin/>\\n </pre>\\n\\nThe browser will preload the page and will make use of the preloaded fonts when called for in the `@font-face URL`. When preloaded assets are not used, you will notice a warning in the console.\\n\\nCouple of things to note here\\n\\n1. The `crossorigin` is a necessary attribute though it looks like you are calling your asset from your website.\\n\\n2. The URL should be an exact match, for instance, you can refer the asset through multiple ways but you have to use the same path in both ways.\\n\\nTo be continued..."},{"id":"/A-developers-review-of-Amazon-Prime-Reading-what-works-what-doesn-t","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/A-developers-review-of-Amazon-Prime-Reading-what-works-what-doesn-t","source":"@site/blog/A-developers-review-of-Amazon-Prime-Reading-what-works-what-doesn-t.md","title":"A developer review of Amazon Prime Reading, what works & what doesn\'t","description":"Amazon prime reading home screen","date":"2020-10-26T22:23:04.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"tech-books","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-books"}],"readingTime":5.04,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"A developer review of Amazon Prime Reading, what works & what doesn\'t","date":"2020-10-26T22:23:04.000Z","tags":["tech-books"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Chrome Lighthouse with dhbalaji.dev as site under study, with fixes","permalink":"/blog/Chrome-Lighthouse-on-dhbalaji-dev-with-fixes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing Google analytics product for developers - Part 1","permalink":"/blog/Introducing-Google-analytics-product-for-developers"}},"content":"![Amazon prime reading home screen](./assets/amazon-prime-reading.webp)\\n\\nAmazon prime reading is a **book lending library** for Amazon prime users. Damn, I stumbled upon this nice feature quite late.\\n\\nHey there, if you have read Russell Conwell\'s book [Acres of diamonds](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/368/368-h/368-h.htm), you can feel what I am undergoing when I discovered Amazon Prime reading in India. As a bibliophile, I am always on the lookout for books and things around them. I am a proud Kindle owner from 2016 and an amazon prime user for a few years but I did not notice the prime reading feature on amazon.\\n\\nAmazon prime reading somehow did not fascinate me in the beginning because my kindle was not registered on an Indian address. It was tagged to Amazon USA, so most titles were not accessible even though I was an amazon prime user in India. Since I was not buying any content on Amazon USA, I decided to move my kindle to Amazon India. Looks like a hustle right. Yes, it is. According to Amazon, I moved my kindle from the USA to India. Right now my kindle is perfectly registered on amazon.in. Voila, the prime reading fun begins now.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Here is how you can make use of amazon prime reading\\n\\n> Prerequisites: Amazon prime account and Kindle device or Kindle app(s) registered on your account\\n\\n### Step1: Visit amazon prime reading catalog\\n\\nOn the [Home screen of Prime reading](https://www.amazon.in/b/ref=sxts_snpl_2_2_f4f37913-f0a7-4ab2-a028-26103a52959f?node=13678423031&pf_rd_p=f4f37913-f0a7-4ab2-a028-26103a52959f&_encoding=UTF8&pf_rd_r=GAGQW150D0QRPPTZ885R&pd_rd_wg=3ZeKO&pd_rd_w=dIhen&qid=1603731131&pd_rd_r=c0117997-0129-4b07-9244-cc547a81b88b), you will find featured books. These books are priced at 0 Rupees for prime user\\n\\n### Step 2: Click on any book, or use the links to genre\\n\\nThe featured books were mostly self-help or fiction books like [Vikram & Betaal](https://www.amazon.in/Vikram-Betaal-Illustrated-Maple-Press-ebook/dp/B01JS7JLBY/ref=lp_13678423031_1_6?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1603731950&sr=1-6). I decided to explore the favorite genre, the computers bookshelf/link which was under non-fiction.\\n\\n![Amazon prime reading genres](./assets/prime-reading-select-genre.webp)\\n\\n### Step 3: Pick your book & read for free!!\\n\\nThe genres on prime-reading might be disappointing but there are few good books out there. Stay curious. I searched in the non-fiction genre and here is what I found.\\n\\n\\n![impressive free non-fiction books on amazon prime](./assets/impressive-free-non-fiction-books.webp)\\n\\nMy happiness knew no bounds when I found a book that I wanted to read for a few years. The author \\"John Sonmez\\" is famous on the internet with his blog [Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/). His other book [Soft skills the software developer\'s life manual](https://www.manning.com/books/soft-skills) sits proudly on my bookshelf. It is also my go-to book during stress because it\'s a life manual for developers. I don\'t think this blog would have come out if I had not read that book.\\n\\n\\n![Somnez book on amazon prime](./assets/sonmez-book.webp)\\n\\nThe above book in paperback format costs upside of 3000 rupees, now you get it for free. Follow the next step.\\n\\n### Step 4: Click Read now\\n\\nThis is the last step and you should be good to read on your kindle. Just make sure your kindle is connected to wifi, the sync is almost instantaneous.\\n\\nIf you have not borrowed, you will notice a button `Read for Free`. If you have already borrowed, then you will notice a button `Read Now`. \\n\\n\\n![Somnez book read now amazon prime](./assets/prime-read-for-free.webp)\\n\\n### Start reading on kindle\\n\\nThere is nothing that you need to do on kindle, just power on your kindle and you are good to go. I am assuming that your kindle is connected to wifi.\\n\\n1. Kindle Starts\\n\\n\\n![kindle starts](./assets/powering-on-kindle.webp)\\n\\n2. Upon wifi connection, the book has synced in Library > Downloaded books\\n\\n\\n![book has synced ](./assets/book-has-synced.webp)\\n\\n3. The book information is shown which is the default behavior for any book\\n\\n\\n![book info](./assets/book-info.webp)\\n\\n4. Meanwhile, on the Kindle apps, I can see a badge on the thumbnail titled `Prime Reading`. Inside I can notice the return book. You can borrow up to 10 books at a time.\\n\\n## What worked in amazon prime reading\\n\\n1. I take solace from the `Send to Kindle` feature to read long posts. Amazon\'s prime reading is as simple as that.\\n\\n2. The sync is perfect. If you do not have a kindle device, it\'s perfectly fine. You can use the Kindle apps for mobile/desktop. They would also enable you to read for free.\\n\\n3. Of course it works offline. No need to be around wifi as usual.\\n\\n## What did not work in amazon prime reading\\n\\nAlmost everything worked as expected. Here are a few shortcomings or gotchas to remember.\\n\\n1. The content could be wider & deeper. I meant the books available for borrowing in the non-fiction section. \\n\\n2. The content would be available as long as you have a valid subscription. You may return the borrowed book but I do not see any due data.\\n\\n3. You can borrow up to 10 books at any given point in time according to their terms and conditions. Later you may have to return the borrowed book.\\n\\n4. You need to be on amazon prime to enjoy prime reading. Prime reading is not sold separately.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\n> When there is no downside to doing something, just do it\\n\\nIt was my self made a quote with some inspiration from elsewhere. I do not see any reason why you should not try prime reading if you are a prime user in India. After all, there is no extra cost. You get free books!!\\n\\nIf you are outside of prime, still there are a lot of free ebooks that are priced at zero rupees which are amazing. You can also sideload books to kindle.

It was google analytics which told me that I had 60,000 plus visits to my blog post related to Micromax Ezpad phone and how to share the phone internet connection with Ubuntu OS.\\n\\nAs a front-end engineer, you cannot get away without writing or copy-pasting analytics code. To work with analytics code effectively, developers need to understand the terms/jargon used by Google analytics. In this blog post, I will share with you an introduction to google analytics in a developer-friendly language.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n\\n## 1. Lets take a look at the product to begin with...\\n\\nThis is how the google analytics product looks like for my blog\\n\\n\\n ![Google-analytics for dhbalaji.dev blog](./assets/dhbalaji-google-analytics-homescreen.webp)\\n \\n For developers who are familiar with other Google products like Google cloud platform UI, the UI should sound similar. Its the same material UI and dashboards.\\n \\n The product has all the \\n \\n * Functionality related UI on the left of the screen.\\n \\n * The home page of Google analytics has reports which are customizable. This is by virtue of dashboard logic. Yes, all dashboards need to be customizable by default.\\n \\n * The information of the user using the analytics application is on the top right. There are a multitude of user privileges you can have in google analytics. It means there will be an admin, a user who can only view, someone who can view and also edit, etc.\\n \\n * Towards the bottom left is the UI to perform admin operations.\\n \\n### 2. Can you describe Google analytics as a system?\\n\\nyes, google analytics is a software system with the below specs.\\n\\n**Primary use** - Analyze the user traffic on the app/web and track conversions.\\n\\n**Input** - Data collected on the website/app/any source by Javascript tracking code.\\n\\n**Output** - Data is shown to the professionals for analytics purposes. The output of google analytics mostly reports.\\n\\n**Processing operations** - Data from trackers code is captured at different stages of the customer journey which is later analyzed by google analytics and saved in a read-only database.\\n\\n**Presentation logic** - A lot of data is collected about the user like his age, demographics, browser, etc. By using the right filters, we can simplify the data for presentation and analysis.\\n\\n**Privacy controls** - Google analytics is privacy-aware, it means you can instruct the system to exclude certain data from getting collected from the user. \\n\\n## 3. How does Google analytics identify each website or app using it?\\n\\nThe identification happens through a **unique ID** which is included in the Javascript trackers code. This unique ID is generated in the admin section of the Google analytics\\n\\n\\n## 4. Is data analytics limited to the web?\\n\\nThe source of data to Google analytics is called **data streams**. The web is of course a popular data stream. The most popular data streams are the \\n\\n* Web\\n* IOS app\\n* Android app\\n\\nFor instance, a web data stream contains information about page views and events performed by the user.\\n\\n\\n## 5. Are there any must know jargon/terms?\\n\\nYes, there are a few of them.\\n\\n**Session** - Can also be called a Page session. The session life cycle is as follows. When a user lands on your website, the session is started. The user then performs some action on your website which is called session events/events. The user leaves your website which marks the end of the session. 30 minutes of user inactivity also marks the end of the session.\\n\\n**Customer Journey** - It is the sequence of steps taken by the user to achieve your goal. Let us say you run an online apparel e-commerce store. Your expected customer journey would be \\n    \\n    1. Visit the product page\\n    \\n    2. Enter payment information and\\n    \\n    3. Place an order for the product. \\n    \\nEach customer journey has a series of steps to be taken by the user. We will be tracking how many users complete each step of the journey. One hundred percent of users on step 1 will not be completing step 3 which leads to another concept called a funnel.\\n \\n**Conversion funnel** - Tracking the number of users at each step of the user journey is called the Conversion funnel. It is also called a sales funnel.\\n\\n**Views** - This is synonymous with a screen/view in a web application. The user of google analytics needs to configure the view for a particular goal, like to view the users on some stage of the customer journey. Once configured, google analytics will capture and process the data required by the view. The collection of data for the view starts when the view is created. One view is deleted, it can be restored for a limited time.\\n\\n## 6. Can I access google analytics with a normal Gmail account?\\n\\nAbsolutely yes, a normal Gmail account can be used to access Google analytics. however, if you are working in a business house, the admin of google analytics will decide if you will have the privilege to access to property and view.\\n\\n## 7. What is google analytics property and view?\\n\\nThe property and view constitute the information hierarchy in Google analytics.\\n\\nIn any product we have information, the information will be organized in a certain manner for retrieval and use. For instance, in MS Excel, we call it `sheets`. On MS Powerpoint we call it `slides`.\\n\\nLet\'s say I have a dhbalaji.pptx file with a slide named \\"Google Analytics\\". The same in Google analytics would be like a property called Dhbalaji and a view called \\"google analytics\\".\\n\\nThe app/website becomes property. The data which you want to analyze becomes a view.\\n\\n## 8. What is the first step for developers to do with Google analytics\\n\\nFor learning purposes,\\n\\n1. Sign in with your Gmail account\\n\\n2. Create a property\\n    1. Creating property gives you tracking code & global site tag\\n    2. Tracking code is unique for your property and you need to put it in the site tag if it\'s not included.\\n    3. Global site tag is a piece of code we need to put in the head section of every page of your website.\\n\\n3. Tag is a keyword to remember. Tags are used for site tracking. When you have multiple tags, we need to manage the tags with the google tag manager.\\n\\n4. Verifying the tag setup is easy. You can see the real-time report and find out the number of active users on your website. The real-time report showed 1 when I set up my Google Analytics on my website.\\n\\n5. For debugging, you have [Tag assistant](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk). Its a free chrome extension offered by Google to work with global site tag code.\\n\\n\\n![gtag.js on dhbalaji.dev blog](./assets/gtagJS-on-dhbalaji.dev.webp)\\n\\n## 9. Show me something advanced that you can do with google analytics\\n\\n1. You can do site linking. It means you can collect sessions from 2 unrelated websites and link them as a single session. It can happen that your user journey runs through 2 websites but the session is treated as one. Is it that not advanced.\\n\\n2. Whether you like it or not, google analytics will set cookies for you. There will be a unique cookie ID for a domain. In the case of site linking. You need to set the same cookie ID for different domains. To do this successfully, you need to know how to set cookies with the response header.\\n\\n3. Google Analytics will not only track the session and the events but also the referrer of the session. Let\'s say a user comes to the Dhbalaji.dev website from LinkedIn. Then LinkedIn becomes the referrer. \\n\\n4. Outbound links to other websites can be tracking with extra JS code in the corresponding event handlers.\\n\\n## 10. What are the out-of-the-box features provided by google analytics?\\n\\nLet us say you set up Google analytics with a global site tag on your website. The following things will happen.\\n\\n1. the page view measurement will happen by default\\n\\n > A single session can have multiple page view. To know why think about the session life cycle."},{"id":"/Chrome-has-browser-monopoly-what-it-means-to-devs-testers-business","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Chrome-has-browser-monopoly-what-it-means-to-devs-testers-business","source":"@site/blog/Chrome-has-browser-monopoly-what-it-means-to-devs-testers-business.md","title":"Chrome has browser monopoly, what it means to developers, testers & business?","description":"Chrome browser mobile","date":"2020-10-18T13:32:34.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"}],"readingTime":3.34,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Chrome has browser monopoly, what it means to developers, testers & business?","date":"2020-10-18T13:32:34.000Z","tags":["frontend"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing Google analytics product for developers - Part 1","permalink":"/blog/Introducing-Google-analytics-product-for-developers"},"nextItem":{"title":"Three good things college education teaches the life long learner","permalink":"/blog/One-good-thing-the-college-education-teaches-the-life-long-learner"}},"content":"![Chrome browser mobile](./assets/chrome-browser-mobile.webp)\\n\\n\\"Which browsers do you support\\" is a lame question when it comes to frontend development. We have techniques like progressive enhancement & graceful degradation which ensures that the application behaves consistently on different browsers. The browser game has changed, Chrome browser has around 70% share in the browser market by users. Should we still support all the browsers?\\n\x3c!-- truncate  --\x3e\\n\\n\\n\\n## Legacy Development Practices\\n\\n* List down the browsers that you would like to support.\\n\\n* Come up with a test plan & prioritize the defects. The modern browsers are tested first and the defects are given higher priority. The cosmetic defects on legacy browsers like IE are treated as low priority and deferred until everything breaks.\\n\\n* There was a banner or message to users about recommended browsers for a particular application. For example, this site works best on chrome.\\n\\n## Moving into the post-IE era\\n\\nMicrosoft decides to take down IE in 2020. The Microsoft browser family continues to run in the name of [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/about-microsoft-edge) which continues to gain popularity as it works like Chrome. It works like chrome because it\'s built on top of chromium. Looks like Microsoft does not want to reinvent the wheel like the way they did for Microsoft mobile OS and mobile devices.\\n\\n### Data privacy which held back chrome is a solved issue\\n\\nMany enterprises were skeptical about browsers like Firefox and Chrome because of unclear data policies. What if employee data falls into wrong hands. This is a solved issue because the Chrome browser gets packaged for enterprises and can be managed by the enterprise admin. They can choose which extensions can be used by employees etc. Ultimately there is no need for IE or another browser from Microsoft because they do not have a USP now.\\n\\nMore about [chrome enterprise browser](https://chromeenterprise.google/browser/download/)\\n\\n## How the future might look after the chrome browser monopoly\\n\\n1. The life of the developer remains the same, we still have to use polyfills, etc as we cannot guarantee what the remaining 30% of users are using.\\n\\n2. Throwing in-browser messages about \\"Works on Chrome\\" is not good user experience. We still need to cater to enterprise or OS browsers like Edge, Safari, Samsung internet browser, etc.\\n\\n3. Apps are gonna be unpredictable based on custom browser modes like\\n\\n    a. Data saver mode\\n    \\n    b. Block trackers and ads mode\\n    \\n    c. Lite mode of parent browsers like Firefox lite\\n    \\n    d. Functionality limiting browser extensions\\n    \\n4. Browser APIs help us do a lot more from web apps like battery API, sensor API, etc.\\n\\n5. Extensions are for niches like developers, shoppers etc. Mainstream apps were taken away from chrome after API got deprecated.\\n\\n6. QA still needs to have a test plan for other OS browsers like Edge, Safari, and Samsung internet browser. Deferring testing on OS browsers could lead to angry customers who would not install the Chrome browser.\\n\\n7. Business analysts need to pay attention to a variety of browsers and need to put in some thought during requirements gathering.\\n\\n8. Service workers and PWA helps developers to build apps for other platforms which work like natively installed apps. I found them saving my time to install and start using. Apart from that, they work like any other app.\\n\\n\\n## Closing notes\\n\\nThere may not be a browser war right away. If it happens it could be related to data sharing and tracking issues among the users. Businesses and bloggers like me should consider a minimum set of browsers like listed below.\\n\\n    Desktop Platform\\n    \\n    1. Google Chrome family of browsers\\n    2. OS browsers like Edge & Safari\\n    3. Firefox\\n    \\n    Tablet Platform\\n    \\n    1. Safari on IOS\\n    2. Chrome browser\\n    3. Chromium\\n    \\n    Mobile Platform\\n    \\n    1. Google Chrome browser\\n    2. OS browsers like Safari\\n    3. Others depending on the region of the customers like UC browsers in APAC region.\\n\\nThis is exactly the same list of browsers against which this [blog](https://dhbalaji.dev/) gets tested against."},{"id":"/One-good-thing-the-college-education-teaches-the-life-long-learner","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/One-good-thing-the-college-education-teaches-the-life-long-learner","source":"@site/blog/One-good-thing-the-college-education-teaches-the-life-long-learner.md","title":"Three good things college education teaches the life long learner","description":"College education teaches","date":"2020-10-18T07:19:59.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"essays","permalink":"/blog/tags/essays"}],"readingTime":1.77,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Three good things college education teaches the life long learner","date":"2020-10-18T07:19:59.000Z","tags":["essays"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Chrome has browser monopoly, what it means to developers, testers & business?","permalink":"/blog/Chrome-has-browser-monopoly-what-it-means-to-devs-testers-business"},"nextItem":{"title":"Server-side rendering vs client-side rendering.

Here I summarize 3 of those tips along with one lifesaver tip.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## 1. Discipline holds the key to progress\\n\\n\\nThere was a reason why they scheduled classes at 8 am when they knew nobody likes to get up early and rush to college. But in hind sight, I realize that nothing can be achieved without discipline.\\n\\nYou better got to schedule the important things in the morning. At least schedule something and stick to it.\\n\\n## 2. Variety of subjects help to connect the dots\\n\\nIt\'s a common thing among developers who just get things rolling. They will be like \\"Oh Balaji, you want us to study that technical book. That is not required at work right?\\". Imagine at college if every subject were elective. People would have just chosen\\n\\n    1. Data structures & Algo\\n    2. C++\\n    3. Java\\n    4. Web programming\\n    5. Android\\n\\nAs a seasoned developer, I understand that\\n\\n    1. Computer networks\\n    2. Operating systems\\n    3. Entrepreneurship\\n    4. Mathematics\\n    5. Software engineering\\n\\nare equally important to become a well rounded professional. \\n    \\n> Next time when you are tempted to avoid learning something outside the box, go for it. Especially be good at Linux concepts.\\n\\n## 3. Have your credit system for any topic of study\\n\\nOne look at the curriculum shows the expected time to complete studying a particular topic. For instance\\n\\nBasics of Java - 2 credits where 1 credit equals a minimum of 30 hours of study. It means you need to spend a minimum of 60 hours outside of classroom hours to master the topic. If someone makes a tutorial which is like 5 hours to master React or a 1000 page book. Most people frown at it. This attitude must change.\\n\\n Give react 2 credits. Slow down and absorb as much as you can from the documentation. Then life would be less stressful. Fill up the hours with `books, videos, and practice hours`. \\n\\n\\n![College education and reading books](./assets/girl-studying.webp)"},{"id":"/How-to-know-if-the-site-has-server-side-rendered-or-client-side-rendered-Answered","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/How-to-know-if-the-site-has-server-side-rendered-or-client-side-rendered-Answered","source":"@site/blog/How-to-know-if-the-site-has-server-side-rendered-or-client-side-rendered-Answered.md","title":"Server-side rendering vs client-side rendering.

Rendering in front-end engineering means, you are generating an HTML view for the user. There are different approaches to render a view. Client-side rendering, server-side rendering are 2 of them\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLet us say I request a home page from the server. If the server sends the full document aka HTML to the browser then we call it server-side rendered. If you `view source` of the page, we can see full HTML under the `body` tag. This blog for example is server-side rendered theoretically. In the case of [React SSR](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html), the reacts components are rendered on the backend, and HTML is sent to the client. Hydration of components will happen on the frontend. During hydration, the event handlers are attached to the markup.\\n\\n\\nIf the server sends a `root` div under the `body` tag where the react DOM will be rendered later by the client, then we call it client-side rendered. When implemented correctly, the client-side rendered apps will have a seamless transition between different pages of the application. By seamless, I mean without reloading the whole page, the web app will behave like a mobile app, loading the screen quickly.\\n\\n> Look for HTML markup under `body` tag. If a full document is found, then its server-side rendered page. If only a placeholder `div` was found, it\'s client-side rendered.\\n\\nOn a side note, there are a subset of apps where the layout DOM is cached on the client. Its also called [app shell](https://medium.com/google-developers/instant-loading-web-apps-with-an-application-shell-architecture-7c0c2f10c73) and the HTML/JSON for the remaining parts are sent from the server.\\n\\n## The technical side of building client-side rendered apps\\n\\nIn client-side communication, we have to take care of 3 important elements of the app. i.e.\\n\\n1. Routing - the URL is matched to the page on the client-side. It simply means there is no HTML page for each route, the router code does the magic of creating a page for the route. If the route is not matching, the client-side logic throws a 404 page if configured. In react, all of this routing is handled by React-router.\\n\\n2. Managing application data - the application data has to be shared between different pages. This calls for better state management which can be done by Redux. Redux is a concept, to make it compatible with reactJS. We use react-redux which gives the right bindings.\\n\\n3. Communicate with the server - We need to persist the user data to the database. This calls for REST API or GraphQL servers.\\n\\nOverall, we are engineering a lot of code to run efficiently on the browser. It means there will megaBytes of minified JS bundles running the app for us.\\n\\n\\n\\n## The technical side of building server-side apps\\n\\n1. The HTML code is written in a templating language like PUG and the data is compiled with the template to generate a page on the server. The generated HTML markup is sent over the network to the browser. The browser\'s time taken for first contentful paint can be reduced significantly by taking a server-side rendering approach.\\n\\n2. We need a more powerful server-side infrastructure because sending JSON data via API is less memory & CPU consuming than sending the whole page to the client\\n\\n\x3c!-- ![server-infra for server-side rendering](./assets/server-side-infra.jpg) --\x3e\\n\\n## Client-side or Server-side rendering? Which one triumph?\\n\\nIf client-side rendering is a clear winner, we would not have libraries like NEXTJS. If the server-side was a clear winner, we would not have an explosion of Javascript frameworks like React stack, Angular, etc.\\n\\nWe have something to learn from NextJS.\\n\\n1. The first request for a page is server-rendered. The client quickly gets to display the document instead of having to parse the JS.\\n\\n2. Subsequent requests are rendered by the client, reducing the load on the servers, reducing resource time & enhanced UX. \\n\\nI prefer the mix of both server + client-side rendering. This combination enhances user experience.\\n\\n#### References\\n\\n[Toptal blog](https://www.toptal.com/front-end/client-side-vs-server-side-pre-rendering)\\n\\n[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)"},{"id":"/Challenges-faced-while-working-with-React-common-interview-question-answered","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Challenges-faced-while-working-with-React-common-interview-question-answered","source":"@site/blog/Challenges-faced-while-working-with-React-common-interview-question-answered.md","title":"What are the challenges faced while working with React? the most common interview question answered","description":"React challenges","date":"2020-10-17T16:56:15.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"frontend","permalink":"/blog/tags/frontend"},{"inline":true,"label":"interview","permalink":"/blog/tags/interview"}],"readingTime":3.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"D Balaji","title":"Lead Design Technologist","url":"https://github.com/dhbalaji","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4","key":"dhbalaji","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"What are the challenges faced while working with React? the most common interview question answered","date":"2020-10-17T16:56:15.000Z","tags":["frontend","interview"],"authors":["dhbalaji"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Server-side rendering vs client-side rendering.

My friend asked me to answer this. Here I go...\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBefore I answer, let me tell me why the interviewer is asking this question. The reasons could be\\n\\n1. It was in their questions script \ud83d\ude42. It\'s an obvious question right, just like tell me about yourself.\\n\\n2. They wanted to gauge your professional expertise. The people who work on basic apps won\'t have many challenges that they can flaunt.\\n\\n3. Some questions need preparation. Just like tell me about yourself needs decent preparation, this question too needs prepared and sincere candidature to answer.\\n\\nI have to admit that I flunked an interview because I could not give a convincing answer as I had a vague memory of the challenge I faced at work. \\n\\n> Narrating an incident from vague memory could be a mess, especially under stress.\\n\\nHere is my tip. Talk about advanced topics like\\n\\na. **Performance issues** which you surmounted on the view layer. In large applications react can be slow, in that case, you need to look into profiler, etc. Talk about it.\\n\\nb. **Making choices**, like the selection of npm-packages. You can even talk about `Redux` vs `Rematch`.\\n\\nc. Workflow pipelines, deployment issues are real. Talk about it. Sometimes customer-facing issues and resolutions make good heroic developer stories.\\n\\nd. Process/Code improvements can be discussed. It could be introducing `React hooks` over `React classes` to the team and going about the migration journey.\\n\\ne. The unit test case that annoyed you, in case you remembered nothing.\\n\\nLet me give you 2 scenarios (I may update the scenarios anytime, so better bookmark this page) where I had serious challenges with React.\\n\\n1. We had a performance issue in one of our <abbr title=\\"Product Display Page\\">PDP</abbr> page. There was a noticeable delay when the user clicks on \'Add to cart\'. We found that the code had some issues like\\n    \\n    a. The selectors were not memoized, leading to delays in providing data. Some selectors did `.toJS()` which gives a new object leading to a re-render of the component.\\n    \\n    b. At the component level, we had issues due to unnecessary re-renders. Some of the components were doing a deeper check for the props, they were replaced by `PureComponent`. React profiler helps us identify react component which get re-rendered a lot or get impacted during re-render. The wider the yellow bar, the longer the component took to re-render. The component needs to be fixed. Generally not passing too many props to a component is a good thing.\\n    \\n2. The other issue was with the React stack itself. Almost every component that you need is on NPM which is good and it\'s the way it should be. Should we use them directly without scrutinizing them? Absolutely not. I was evaluating react-content editable which was 5.1kB which was huge given that React is itself 6.1kB. Keeping in sight the features that you use and bundle size is important while choosing the npm-packages. It\'s a good practice to constantly check the size of packages and their equivalents.\\n\\n**Final tip:** Prepare your answer in advance and do not rely on memory. The answer you say will be judged during the interview. There are plenty of engineering challenges, its about discovery, resolution and documentation so that you can refresh your memory before the interview.\\n    \\n    \\nOther links\\n\\n[Bundle phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react@16.14.0) -- a tool which tells the size of npm packages"}]}}')}}]);
