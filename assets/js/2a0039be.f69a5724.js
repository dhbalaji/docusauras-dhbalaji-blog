The XP OS started crashing frequently and I was forced to consider giving ubuntu CDs a try. The timing was right, the broadband penetration at Indian towns made Ubuntu adoption easy. Back then DVD full of software was the norm to distribute software for home PCs. With an ubuntu and 256Kbps broadband connection, I was able to explore new horizons.
