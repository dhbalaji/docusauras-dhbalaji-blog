Today, let me sweep you into the epicenter of Indian tradition —  
a **Telugu wedding**, the grand theatre where **culture and opulence waltz together**,  
hand in hand, just like the beaming bride and groom at the sacred mandap.

Fragrant **jasmine**, **marigold garlands** blooming in every corner,  
and that unmistakable melody of the **nadaswaram** weaving through the air.  
The priest’s chants rise and fall as cousins dart about, balancing overflowing **tamboolams**,  
and somewhere in the background — the intoxicating scent of **fresh pulihora and ghee**  
does its own aarti in your nostrils.

## 🍽️ On the dining front…

A spectacle awaits!

- Twenty tongue-tingling dishes  
- Elegantly arranged on a **fifteen-inch banana leaf** — so big,  
  only Lord Ganesha himself could contemplate finishing it all.

Eight cameramen zigzagging through the crowd,  
determined to capture every **stolen glance and every blink**.

And in the midst of this pageantry:  
Our glowing bride — wrapped in ornate **Kanchivaram silk**,  
draped in layers of jewelry,  
her smile never faltering over the **5-hour-long reception**.

But not to be outdone — the **dining hall videographer** springs into action,  
bellowing:  
> “Before touching your papad, SMILE and display your banana leaf!”

## 💑 And after the ceremonies…

The couple step into married life,  
armed with blessings, ladoos,  
and the hope of building a home on a foundation of **love, laughter, and stable finances**.

Mrs. Rao? A **champ at equity investing**.  
Ever the cheerleader, Rao gave her access to his wallet along with his heart.  
Soon, her stocks soared —  
and the home felt blessed by **Lakshmi herself**.

---

Indian bureaucracy respects **documents more than declarations of love**.

Suddenly, like a twist in a family drama, Rao heard:  
> “According to tax law, your wife is poor. The profits are yours alone.”

Wait — what?!  
All those rituals?  
All those sacred vows?  
The **mangalsutra** — the symbols of union?

**Vanish** before the cold logic of a **tax table**?

Here, in the land of **Parvati-Parameshwar** and **Sita-Rama**, our marriages are **eternal**…  
but the **taxman thinks we’re just flatmates sharing rent!**

---

## 🧾 Let’s decode this…

### ✅ Scenario One:

If Mr. Rao earns and **gifts** any asset to Mrs. Rao —  
shares, FDs — out comes the waving finger:

> “Arre bhai, this paisa is still yours!”

**Gold? Sarees? Bangles?** Fine.  
But **assets that grow**?  
**Club and tax please!**

So a woman who steers the family budget, invests,  
or runs the household like a **CEO** —  
still remains “poor” in the eyes of the law,  
her worth measured in **tolas, not talent**.

---

### ✅ Scenario Two:

If **both partners earn** —  
live under the same roof,  
eat from the same **fridge**,  
and store documents in the same **Godrej almirah**…

The taxman coolly declares:  
> “You are financially unrelated. Joint returns? That’s not our sanskar.”

**Sorry, housewives!**  
No **Form 16**, no recognition — just resignation.

Income tax — where logic goes missing **faster than a spoon at a wedding buffet**.

## 👩‍👩‍👧 The invisible tax on women

Mothers, wives, grandmothers —  
women who keep the **diya glowing**, the **family thriving** — are invisible.

Their value? In **carats**, not **capability**.

What an irony…  
In a land that **worships Goddess Lakshmi**,  
but refuses to **count her** in our ledgers!

---

### 📉 Example:

- A **solo earner** pays ₹6 lakhs tax on ₹30 lakhs.
- A **double-income couple, 15L each**? Just ₹3 lakhs combined.
- An **NRI uncle** with a suitcase full of tissue paper?  
  Taxman says, “Come, enjoy, no tax!”

## 🧘‍♀️ Time to reform…

Our scriptures remind us:

> “Where women are honored, there even the gods dwell.”

But our **tax code**?  
Still living like a **bachelor** — blissfully immune to Indian family values!

---

## 📢 Friends, it’s time we ask…

Why must laws treat families who **walk together**, **pray together**, and **dream together**  
as separate entries in a **ledger**?

---

### 💬 Let’s urge our policymakers:

- Stop inventing new taxes on **popcorn and caramel popcorn**!  
- Instead, recognize what India has always known:  
  **Families are our strength.**

Let’s bring **reforms for joint filing**.

Won best speaker of the day at Hosur TM club. Although I would never attempt a speech with social message. Hard to deliver with full energy because someone might get offended, income tax dept in this case.
