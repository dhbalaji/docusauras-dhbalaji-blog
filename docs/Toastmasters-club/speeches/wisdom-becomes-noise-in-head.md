# 🎤 Rumbles of my wisdom

Let me confess something. I’m in my mid-thirties, and it’s… stressful. You’re not young enough to be forgiven, nor old enough to be taken seriously. The younger generation ignores your experience like a TED Talk no one ever clicks on YouTube. The seniors skip your advice like an unskippable ad they wish was skippable.

So you end up with wisdom swirling inside your head like static — loud, persistent, and unheard — especially when you clearly see something going wrong.

Here are three people from my life who believe they’re on the right path, while my inner wisdom keeps screaming otherwise.

## Number 1: Harika — the Eight-Year-Old CEO

Harika is eight. And somehow, her weekly schedule looks busier than an actual CEO’s.

Mornings begin with karate, afternoons with guitar, online art class somewhere in between, evening cycling, and late nights spent trying to master two regional languages — thanks to the central and state governments’ “mandatory” vibes.

I want to tell her, “Stop. Slow down.”
You cannot become a karate master by attending one-hour classes. You cannot become a rockstar by touching your guitar once a week.

Focused work creates miracles; scattered effort creates stress.

### Number 2: Aravind — the Dreamer Who Pressed Pause

Aravind recently shared the big news — he got a job at a tech company after college.
I was taken aback. This is the same guy who dreamt of building a cybersecurity company… and he was the perfect fit for it.

But he traded that dream for the comfort of a job.
He convinced himself that he would “learn enough” at work to strengthen his dream later.

This is a lie — because his employer has nothing to do with cybersecurity.
A few choices quietly alter the entire course of your life.

### Number 3: Suhas — the Unsold Bachelor in the Marriage Marketplace

Suhas is an eligible bachelor whose dreams are still unsold in the arranged marriage market.
I don’t blame him for having high, commercial expectations — it’s become the norm.

Today’s bachelors treat marriage like a formula:
A plus B, the whole square
which somehow translates to:
Fancy houses + Two incomes + Wealthy families.

I want to tell Suhas to remove any one of the three and replace it with unconditional love.
But he’s fixated.

This trend is alarming. It weakens the very foundation of family bonds.
What if one person faces job issues? Will the other “fire” them with a divorce?
Rethink, my dear juniors. Please rethink.

### Conclusion

Although the wisdom in my head rumbles whenever I see the choices of my juniors and elders, I’ll conclude in the interest of time.

Wisdom not respected is normal.
Don’t be afraid to let the voice in your mind echo across the room — even if no one listens today.

Thank you.
