> “There are infinite possibilities in front of you,”  
> said the chief guest at my graduation.

At 22, I looked at my options... and laughed.

I had just four:

- Option One  
Do nothing.  
Float in the corporate sea, pretend to like meetings, and wait 40 years for a gold-plated retirement mug.

- Option Two  
Higher studies haha, my mind said you cannot. I wallet said you cannot afford either.

- Option Three  
Govt jobs. Application, reservation, corruption, not for a rebel soul like me.

- So I picked the fourth: Entrepreneurship.

## ☕ Hyderabad, 2012

I was in an auto, charged up with an idea.

> “Let’s sell men’s products online,” I told my colleague.  
>  
> He replied, “Bro, we’ll crush it.”  
>  
> He did.  
> My wallet.

In the name of *market research*, he bought clothes — for himself.  
Every follow-up was in a café.  
Every café came with ₹280 coffee and ₹0 execution.

Eventually, I developed a condition: **coffee allergy**.

## 👨‍💻 Then came consulting…

I helped small businesses go digital.  
Thought we’d grow rich together.

But 90% of small businesses fail —  
and I had a gift for picking the **exact 90%**.

One client paid me with gifts.  
Another gave me *blessings*.  
After a few months, I didn’t have clients.  
I had **unpaid therapy sessions**.

## 💡 Enter my ₹0 startup

I opened a Zoom account and helped professionals solve tech issues on weekends.  
Sounds premium? It was basically **online tuition with a startup pitch**.

- Five years.  
- Six hundred weekends.  
- One man.  

Yay, I tasted success.

## 🤖 Then, AI walked in

It didn’t knock.  
It barged in, ate my business, and left me staring at the ceiling at 2AM.

- Slide decks? Gone.  
- Troubleshooting? Gone.  
- Tech help? Replaced by a **bot that never sleeps or needs chai**.

I didn’t just lose clients.  
I lost **purpose**.

---

## 🙃 Then came the “support”

- Family checked my horoscope to see why my startup failed.  
- Grandma judged my pitch: “Good idea... maybe after marriage.”  
- Friends said, “Don’t share your failures. What will others think?”

So I smiled in public.  
And cried into my invoices.

They cheered — as long as I didn’t dream too loud.

---

## 💔 They said: Be practical

But this is what practicality looks like:

- Missing weddings.  
- Skipping weekends.  
- Fighting doubt with nothing but **Google Docs and gut feel**.

No one sees the **invisible tax** you pay for dreaming differently —  
the loneliness, the long hours, the emotional EMIs.

---

## 🔧 But we still build

We fix real problems.  
Hyperlocal problems.  
The kind that never make headlines, but actually make lives easier.

---

## 💭 And what keeps us going?

Entrepreneurship is like taking moonshots. If you succeed, you will make a little fortune and change the economic fate of few families by providing them jobs. Thats what keeps me moonlighting, fighting the odds and showing up.

**Thank you.**
