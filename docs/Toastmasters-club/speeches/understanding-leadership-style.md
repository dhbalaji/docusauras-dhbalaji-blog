# 🎤 The Pacesetter's Dilemma
*Toastmasters Pathways – Understanding your Leadership Style*

---

## 💡 The "Aha" Moment

I recently had an important "aha" moment about my leadership style.
I discovered that I am a **"Pacesetter."**

Now, I could spend five minutes explaining the textbook definition, but where's the fun in that?
Instead, let me take you into a story that plays out in my head.

## 🎬 The Movie in My Head

Imagine a dimly lit room.
**Arjun**, the son of a corrupt politician who is now the Chief Minister, stands surrounded by secretaries who hold him in little respect.

But Arjun? He is on a mission. He is determined to bring **clean politics**.
To set a powerful example, he does the unthinkable:
He returns **20,000 crores** of corrupt money amassed by his father.

The secretaries are **shocked back to reality**.

With this same fire, Arjun pushes to make **zero tolerance of corruption** into law.
But shockingly, his own party members refuse to vote for it.

Faced with this resistance, Arjun makes a compromise—he exempts politicians from some parts of the law—and finally, the bill passes.
Though not perfect, he has managed to reduce corruption significantly.

## 🏢 The Reality Check

I see myself in Arjun’s shoes.
(Though please understand, I don’t face political battles or have 20,000 crores to return!)

I lead a team of engineers at work.
My inner pacesetter demands **speed** and **perfection**.
I want us to be the Arjun of our domain—relentless, efficient, and uncompromising.

But here’s the difficult part.
When **performance review time** comes, I feel as if I’ve been **punched in the stomach**.

## 🥊 The Conflict

Because reality isn’t a movie. Reality isn’t perfect.

Many of my team members score around **3 out of 5**.
Not because they don’t try hard.
Not because they lack talent.

But because of:
- 📉 Tough circumstances
- 📚 Steep learning curves
- 🌪️ The complexities of corporate life beyond anyone’s control. Some of them are contractors.

Yet when I hand out final ratings, I often have to **nudge these scores up to 4 out of 5**.
Not to fudge numbers.
But to:
- Protect morale
- Maintain team spirit
- Help my teammates keep their careers afloat in rough waters

## ⚖️ The Balance

This tension tears at me each time.

My inner pacesetter screams for **results**.
Yet my role—my **true leadership**—is about balancing that drive with **empathy**.
About matching lofty ambitions with **patience**.

Like Arjun, I wrestle with the gap between **ideals and reality**.

Because leadership isn’t just about setting a furious pace.
It’s about asking:
> **Who can truly run with you? And how fast can they go?**

It’s about lifting those who struggle to keep up—without losing sight of the goal.

And here’s the hardest lesson I'm learning:
Leading a team that isn’t always as fast as you dream, while knowing that **slowing down too much means losing momentum**.

**Thank you.**
