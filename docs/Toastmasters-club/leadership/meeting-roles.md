# Meeting Roles

## Evaluator

### Intro to speaker

Good [morning/afternoon/evening] fellow Toastmasters and guests. Before I share my evaluation, let’s quickly revisit why we do this. Evaluation is not about fault-finding — it’s about spotlighting strengths and giving constructive, actionable suggestions for growth. We look at three things: what worked well, what can be improved, and how to improve it. The aim is simple — leave the speaker encouraged, inspired, and eager to take the stage again. With that in mind, here are today’s evaluation guidelines…

### Presenting evaluation

The Evaluator speech is structured into four key sections:

1. **Opening** – Brief, impactful introduction
2. **Commendations** – Speaker’s strengths with supporting evidence
3. **Recommendations** – Targeted, actionable suggestions for improvement
4. **Conclusion** – Summary and motivational closing

This format is ideal for evaluation contests and can be adapted for regular club meetings with minor adjustments.

> With creativity and impromptu speaking skills, this approach also suits the **General Evaluator** role.

#### Opening (15 seconds)

Good [morning/afternoon/evening] Madam/Mister Toastmaster, fellow Toastmasters, and guests. Today, I had the privilege of experiencing a speech that seamlessly blended compelling ideas with heartfelt delivery—a testament to both skill and courage.

**Tips:**
- Keep it positive and concise
- Avoid restating the speech title or summary—focus on impact

#### Sample Evaluator Opening Lines

1. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] Madam/Mister Toastmaster. Today, I witnessed a speech that was a delightful blend of passion, structure, and heart.

4. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. A great speech entertains the mind and touches the heart. Today, we experienced both.
5. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] fellow Toastmasters. Some speeches teach, some inspire. This one did both while keeping us captivated throughout.

7. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. Today’s speech reminded us that authenticity is the best form of persuasion.
8. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] fellow Toastmasters. A good speech speaks to the mind; a great one speaks to the heart. This was the latter.
9. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] Madam/Mister Toastmaster. From the moment the speaker began, there was an undeniable connection with the audience.
10. Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. Speeches are like music—today’s had rhythm, flow, and moments that truly resonated.

#### Commendations (75 seconds)

**Purpose:** Highlight what worked well and why it was effective.

- Link each commendation to a specific moment in the speech
- Focus on high-value techniques:
  - Seamless delivery and polished transitions
  - Authentic storytelling—relatable, credible, heartfelt
  - Vivid imagery—painting pictures in the mind
  - Audience connection—emotional or intellectual engagement

**Tip:** Use the “Because…” method—Praise → Evidence → Impact

Example: Your use of vivid imagery, such as describing the sunrise as golden fingers stretching across the sky, drew the audience into your world, making us feel the scene as if we were there.

##### Sample Commendations

1. Your opening line captured attention instantly and set the tone for the entire speech.
2. Your storytelling felt authentic, making it easy for the audience to connect with you.
3. The imagery you painted allowed us to see, hear, and feel your scenes vividly.
4. Your use of pauses gave the audience space to absorb your message.
5. The structure of your speech flowed logically, guiding us effortlessly from start to finish.

#### Recommendations (75 seconds)

**Purpose:** Suggest specific, actionable ways to elevate the speech.

- Prioritize what would make the biggest impact
- Common areas to assess:
  - Stage presence and movement
  - Vocal variety and modulation
  - Word choice and rhetorical devices
  - Audience connection and engagement
  - Alignment between title and content

**Tips:**
- Avoid generic feedback—make it tailored to the speaker
- Frame recommendations as opportunities, not faults
- Show breadth—contest-level evaluators spot subtleties others miss

Example: At the climax, a pause of two seconds before revealing the key message would have amplified its impact and allowed the audience to fully absorb your words.

##### Sample Recommendations

1. Consider adding a brief, attention-grabbing hook at the start to engage the audience immediately.
2. A slight pause after your key points could give them more weight and let the audience reflect.
3. Exploring more vocal variety can help highlight emotional shifts in your story.
4. Varying your pace—slowing down for impact and speeding up for excitement—can make the delivery more dynamic.
5. Strategic stage movement could visually reinforce your speech structure.

#### Conclusion (15 seconds)

**Purpose:** Reinforce the value of your feedback and motivate the speaker.

Example:
In summary, your speech was a testament to your skill and passion. With a touch more vocal variety and deliberate pacing, it can evolve from impressive to unforgettable. I look forward to your next speech.

**Tips:**
- End with encouragement
- Keep it short and uplifting

#### Sample Evaluator Closing Lines

1. In summary, this was a well-crafted speech, and I look forward to seeing your future projects shine even brighter.
2. With a few refinements, this speech can evolve from impressive to unforgettable—and I know you’ll get there.
3. Your message today mattered, and I hope you keep sharing it with the same passion.

The time for evaluations is **2 to 3 minutes**.

- 🟩 **Green card** – 2:00 minutes
- 🟧 **Orange card** – 2:30 minutes
- 🟥 **Red card** – 3:00 minutes

> ⌛ **30 seconds grace period**—Avoid saying “Thank you” just to fill time.

## General Evaluator

### Opening (3–4 min)

Good [morning/afternoon/evening] fellow Toastmasters and guests. My role as General Evaluator is similar to a movie critic—but for today’s meeting. I’ll be looking at the big picture: what worked well, what could be improved, and how we can make our next meeting even better.

**Role Explanation (30 sec)**

> While the speech evaluators focus on individual speakers, I evaluate the entire meeting—from the start time, agenda flow, and energy, to how each role player performed. My goal is not just to find gaps, but to highlight strengths.

Call on role players (Ah Counter, Grammarian, Timer) to explain their roles to the audience.

### Closing (3–4 min)

Call on role players (5–6 min):

- Invite Speech Evaluators to give their evaluations (if not already done in meeting flow).
- Invite Ah Counter, Grammarian, Timer, and any other meeting role players to present their reports.
- Acknowledge their contributions.

**Structure:**

- **Strengths:**
  - Meeting started on time / smooth transitions / engaging Table Topics / positive energy
- **Opportunities:**
  - Time management / stronger openings & closings / audience engagement tips
- **Suggestions:**
  - One or two actionable improvements for the next meeting

> That concludes my evaluation. Remember, feedback is the breakfast of champions—and judging by today’s meeting, we’ve got a very healthy breakfast habit. Back to you, Toastmaster of the Day.

## Note

A quick note on two very special roles — Toastmaster of the Day and Topics Master. These are not ‘read-from-a-script’ positions. They are the meeting’s flavour-makers. The TMOD sets the theme, mood, and flow, while the Topics Master brings spontaneity and energy. If we start handing out fixed scripts for them, we remove the room for personal stories, experiments, and those delightful surprises that make meetings memorable. So, think of these roles as an open canvas — the more you colour them with your own ideas, the more vibrant our meeting becomes.
