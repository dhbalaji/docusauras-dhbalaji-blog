# Meeting Roles

## Evaluator

The Evaluator speech is structured into four key sections:

1. **Opening** – Brief, impactful introduction
2. **Commendations** – Speaker’s strengths with supporting evidence
3. **Recommendations** – Targeted, actionable suggestions for improvement
4. **Conclusion** – Summary and motivational closing

This format is ideal for evaluation contests and can be adapted for regular club meetings with minor adjustments.

> With creativity and impromptu speaking skills, this approach also suits the **General Evaluator** role.
