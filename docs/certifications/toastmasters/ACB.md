## Hardest parts of the certification

- Selecting the right manuals (you need to choose 2 categories) that align with career goals.
- Peer pressure while choosing manuals, esoteric manuals won't be liked by club members, aka absence of right audience
- Unavailability of skilled mentors
- Dedication and time required for study is high compared to previous level

## Who should take this certification

- Passionate speakers who wish to challenge themselves
