## X

X has long been my go-to platform for staying updated on tech trends directly from library creators and industry leaders. While my past engagement on the [X platform](https://x.com/dhbalaji) has been limited, I’m now leveraging it to amplify my voice in the frontend community.

Purpose: To share and consume the latest frontend engineering trends while building a following among developers.

Strategy:
- Post quick tips, code snippets, and hot takes on industry topics (e.g., “Is WebAssembly the future of frontend? Let’s discuss! #WebDev”).
- Promote new YouTube videos, GitHub repos, and blog posts to drive traffic to other platforms.
- Engage with trending conversations using hashtags like #Frontend, #React, and 
JavaScript.
- Share valuable, concise content to establish credibility and spark discussions.

## YouTube

YouTube is where developers turn to learn, connect, and grow. It’s an ideal platform for me to share my knowledge, build trust, and engage directly with my audience through video content on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dhbalaji-dev).

Purpose: To provide code walkthroughs, tutorials, and explanations that resonate with aspiring developers and showcase my expertise to potential clients.

Strategy:
- Create concise, high-value videos (8-15 minutes) on topics like “Building a PWA with React” or “Debugging Common Frontend Issues.”
- Share code walkthroughs with a camera to add a personal touch and build rapport.
- Include clear CTAs to direct viewers to my GitHub repos, website, or courses.
- Optimize videos with descriptive titles, thumbnails, and tags to boost discoverability.
