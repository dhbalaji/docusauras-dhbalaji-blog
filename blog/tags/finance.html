<p>In the pursuit of financial success, individuals often dedicate a significant amount of time to consuming financial news, financial literature, minimalist techniques or simply ask their friends for ideas. In this article, we will focus on four essential pillars of financial success for individuals with an Indian background. By following these principles, individuals can strive towards a more secure and prosperous financial future.</p>
<p>By focusing on steady income growth, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and holding long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and build a solid foundation for the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="steady-growing-income">Steady growing income<a href="#steady-growing-income" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Steady growing income" title="Direct link to Steady growing income" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Establishing a steady growing income is a fundamental principle for individuals in India who aspire to achieve financial success. In a country where many middle-class individuals experience limited job growth and security, relying on a single source of income can be precarious. Personally they have to rack up atleast one year worth of expenses in a liquid fund or fixed deposit which I categorize as lazy funds.</p>
<p>Its surprising to see senior advocates, doctors, businessmen making handsome income in their late 80s but a retired engineer making nothing other than his pension if any.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #1: Choosing a retirement proof career is key in financial planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are already mid way through career, start and grow a promising business because business owner cannot be fired or forced to retire by labour laws.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="declining-or-reduced-liabilities">Declining or reduced liabilities<a href="#declining-or-reduced-liabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Declining or reduced liabilities" title="Direct link to Declining or reduced liabilities" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, individuals in India would secure employment within their local communities and often live with extended family or in joint households. Consequently, recurring expenses such as rent, electricity, and locking up money in the form of advances or security deposits were relatively unheard of. However, the modern lifestyle has led to an alarming increase in imprudent accumulation of liabilities. Even before securing employment, individuals often find themselves burdened with education loans, followed by payday loans soon after receiving their first salary. While it is not fair to blame individuals entirely, the expenses associated with metropolitan living necessitate managing multiple financial responsibilities with a limited income, leaving minimal room for savings in their 40s.</p>
<p>Maintaining strong family connections, prioritizing children&#x27;s needs, and preserving cultural traditions can quickly deplete financial resources, making one&#x27;s 30s more challenging than anticipated. Ultimately, achieving financial success requires generating income several times greater than one&#x27;s liabilities. If it proves difficult to substantially increase income, it is imperative to focus on reducing costs and minimizing liabilities. Many successful individuals have chosen to retain modest lifestyles, refraining from upgrading furniture, driving smaller vehicles, and using the same vehicle for extended periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #2: Avoid the shiny, fad and impractical expenses. Think long term before you commit for something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="not-incurring-major-losses">Not incurring major losses<a href="#not-incurring-major-losses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Not incurring major losses" title="Direct link to Not incurring major losses" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the path to wealth creation has always been filled with risks and uncertainties. A notable story from the book &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; recounts an individual who lost their investments due to misguided advice when purchasing gold, resulting in poor decision-making. Today, individuals continue to face similar challenges, often influenced by biased recommendations from stockbrokers, mis-selling insurance agents, and other vested interests. Countless individuals have taken leaps of faith only to discover that their ventures led to significant financial losses, whether through failed businesses or ill-informed investment decisions. Such losses can have long-term consequences on one&#x27;s financial stability and progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #3: In new ventures, Diversify even if the returns are less because losing capital means losing the game of financial success.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="create--holding-long-term-growth-assets">Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets<a href="#create--holding-long-term-growth-assets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets" title="Direct link to Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Anecdotally, we often encounter stories of individuals who achieved substantial wealth by merely leading ordinary lives and retaining inherited ancestral properties. While inheriting wealth is undoubtedly advantageous, those without such fortune must exchange their money for the creation, growth, and retention of assets.</p>
<p>It is essential to recognize that assets need not be limited to gold, stocks, or land. Owning a thriving tea stall in a strategic location that was once neglected but is now a prime spot exemplifies a valuable asset. Many successful family businesses in India trace their roots back to the entrepreneurial efforts of grandparents who fearlessly embarked on ventures that yielded fruitful returns.</p>
<p>Rather than advocating for excessively frugal lifestyles or sacrificing vacations to save money, it is more advantageous to focus on creating assets that can generate significant returns over the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #4: Put time in creating assets instead of trying to save rupees in short term</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The road to financial success is not easy especially when you have a family which includes dependents, a society who pushes new fads like spending 2 lakhs on child first birthday, a govt which introduces taxes on whatever you do and use, a job where growth is like a slow moving train, etc. But good use of money can make you comfortable financially. Its okay to be comfortable than be miserable in terms of money.</p>
<p>Achieving financial success in India requires a combination of discipline, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective. By prioritizing a steady growing income, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and focusing on long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and increase their chances of achieving their financial goals.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/finance">finance</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/groww-app-user-meetings">Groww App users meeting in Krishnagiri</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-04-19T15:30:22.000Z">April 19, 2023</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Groww welcome photo" src="/assets/images/groww-welcome-photo-32fcc7814f71b1f01221d365f738d164.webp" width="720" height="1280" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>Post covid, I do not attend in person meetings. Hey Covid, you added bunch of excuses to the list. I do not use Groww app however I decided to attend this meeting to hear the financial jargon. This meeting was first of its kind, a meeting about finances is not something that happens often in upcoming cities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="venue-and-arrangements">Venue and arrangements<a href="#venue-and-arrangements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Venue and arrangements" title="Direct link to Venue and arrangements" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The venue was in district headquarters or Taluk. The hotel was in a decent location, well-connected to all means of transport. Event had adequate branding arrangements. Not too flashy or the absence of it.</p>
<p>There was a small stage suitable for one speaker to stand and present his contents to a room of 50 to 75 people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/groww-stage-eb02adef443b71bfbbd6e3b734a3529e.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>I reached the venue first, and it was an empty room but towards the end, the hall was full.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="audience">Audience<a href="#audience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Audience" title="Direct link to Audience" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Free tickets were to be booked on eventbrite platform in advance.</p>
<p>The room had people who where in their teens until retirement. I think the Groww team estimated the audience demographic details by their experience. They had a certified financial planner to give a financial talk for close to 1.5 hours.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="speaker">Speaker<a href="#speaker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speaker" title="Direct link to Speaker" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>His name is Karthik, and he is a CFA. Because that&#x27;s all we know about him. There was hardly any speaker introduction or hype or welcome address.</p>
<p>The speaker also did not do PR for Groww. The speaker maintained a neutral view without being sales focused.</p>

<p>The general purpose of a speech presented by the CFP would essentially be around having a financial plan in place, identifying goals and arranging corpus for goals. The speaker delivered a well crafted speech backed by research and data.</p>
<p>Let me present the unique points apart from stock selection theory, retirement planning, investment choices which were spoken on the stage.</p>

<p>Let us assume you are an informed investor. You would select a sector, then industry, and then the stock. But have you compared the stock pick with the peers thoroughly? I do not do that because I know only about company X and not its peers.</p>
<p>The simplest way to compare would be to use screener website peers table or make your own table with key KPI and access the peers closely. We might pick a better stock in this approach.</p>
