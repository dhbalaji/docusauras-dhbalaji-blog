## Here is what happened in the last week

1. AI Engineer - Vibe coding was discussed and experimented. Vibe in ML is about marrying data, algorithms and LLM generated code to build apps. The free tool under study was firebase studio, the performance was great until it broke. Yes, there was a small glitch but we got lucky when we were able to backup code to github. Verdict: Vibe coding is promising.

2. Software Engineer - The backends are tricky and needs architecture decisions more than frontends. We believe a tool like firebase could ease up development so that we can focus on adding business value rather than being obsessed about code

3. Entrepreneur - When entrepreneur narrate a business idea, its like a large cap company business model. Highly diversified revenue sources, wonderful team under the belly and customers who are waiting in queues. However as a realist I dismiss most of the noise and listen to the problem that they are solving. What started as a responsible and accountable community builder app was actually an stall in an wedding venue. More on it, if it takes off.

4. Stock Investor - Well, we found strong market recovery followed by panics in the market after Indo-pak. Gold is sliding on the positive sentiments in Russia Ukraine war talks and trump visit to Middle east. However the notable event is the Moody downgrade of US bonds. Expect volatility and continue SIP.

5. CA - Yet to be identified

6. Businessman - Heard a story about a unnamed businessman. The unnamed businessman had all the odds against him. He was dwarf, had a feminine voice, no fancy education yet managed a mid cap company. How is that possible? The unnamed businessman had altered the environment to work for him, for example he would speak very little and softly with signs his assistant would understand. The office was flamboyant which makes his clients and fellow stakeholder feel his power. He has masked his shortcomings and worked on his strengths

7. Local realtor - Yet to be identified
