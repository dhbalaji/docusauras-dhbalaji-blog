# Baby on Board, Firewalls Up: A New Dad’s Guide to Internet Hygiene at Home

We’re expecting a baby soon, and as I prepare for sleepless nights and diaper disasters, there’s one more thing I want to get ahead of — the internet. Yes, the same magical place that helps make money is also crawling with algorithmic predators waiting to turn our kids into scroll zombies before they even learn to walk.

So here’s my no-fluff, nerd-dad guide to securing your digital den — whether you're tech-savvy or just tech-suspecting.

## Step 1: Understand Your Home Network Like a Responsible Adult

Most homes today are multi-network setups, even if they don’t realize it.

### Count the Networks

**Total Networks at home =** 1 broadband + each phone with an active mobile data plan

That means your child's screen time could sneak in through any of these entry points. First step: identify and isolate them.

### Basic Network Topology (Before Changes)

> Internet → ISP Router (Wi-Fi & LAN) → All Devices → your child

This gives the ISP's router full control over DNS, firewall rules, and device access. Not ideal for a security-conscious parent.

> Smart phones + data packs → your child

Data packs by carrier dont give any parental control tools.

We need to target the network level filtering which is generally good enough to block ads, parked domains and time wasters.

## Step 2: Fix the Manhole — Lock Down Your Broadband

### Why ISP Routers Are a Problem

- Most ISP routers are locked down — DNS settings greyed out
- Firmware is often outdated and insecure
- Limited or no parental control features
- No custom firewall or VLAN options

### What I Did Instead

1. **Disabled Wi-Fi on the ISP router**  
   Let it act as a basic modem or Layer 2 switch.

2. **Introduced My Own Router (Netgear)**  
   Plugged into the ISP box via Ethernet (LAN to WAN). This separates my internal LAN from the ISP's network.

3. **Enabled NAT, DHCP, and DNS on My Router**  
   Configured to issue private IPs (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) and point all DNS queries to **OpenDNS** servers which look like:

   - `208.67.222.222`
   - `208.67.220.220`

4. **Registered with OpenDNS**  
   Created a free account, added my dynamic IP, and enabled category-level filtering. You can block:

   - Social networks
   - Video sharing
   - Adult content
   - Gaming, shopping, forums — up to you

5. **Tested the Setup**  
   Verified DNS override by visiting:  
   `https://welcome.opendns.com`

### Updated Network Topology

All devices now talk to the internet via **my firewall + DNS filters**, not the ISP’s.

## Step 3: Taming the Phones — Especially the Ones With Data Packs

Broadband is fixed, but what about **mobile data** on phones? These are the real backdoors.

### Simple But Effective Plan

- Recharge only when needed (no monthly auto-renewal of data-heavy packs)
- Use mobile data only for OTPs, emergency maps, and short bursts

### The Engineer's Setup

I needed something **robust and centrally managed**.

1. **For Broadband Devices** – I use **OpenDNS** via the router.
2. **For Mobile Data (4G/5G) Devices** – I use **NextDNS** via Android/iPhone's Private DNS feature.

#### Why NextDNS?

- Supports DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), apps I control you.
- Per-device logs, analytics, and block rules
- Works even over mobile data, friends hotspot
- One profile can be shared across multiple devices
- For entire family, basic plan is worth it. I dont think free plan will make it.

### How to Set It Up on Android

- Go to: `Settings > Network & Internet > Private DNS`
- Choose: `Private DNS provider hostname`
- Enter: `your-profile-id.dns.nextdns.io` (from nextdns.io dashboard)
- Save and test at: `https://test.nextdns.io`

Now even on 4G, your DNS traffic is encrypted and filtered.

## The Bigger Motive: Family-Wide Digital Discipline

This isn’t just about protecting a newborn. It’s about reprogramming how **we** use the internet — so that the baby doesn’t see everyone glued to screens 24/7.

### What We’re Trying to Do

- Remove addictive triggers from devices
- Encourage meaningful use of tech
- Create consistency across screens
- Lead by example

This is not a one-man battle. It’s a full-stack family-level architecture decision.

## Problems Faced

### Technical

- Changing DNS is straightforward if you’re used to router admin pages.
- Most modern routers support this out of the box.

### Psychological

- Asking aging parents to give up binge-watching YouTube is like asking them to skip tea.
- You’ll hear:
  - “What’s wrong with watching one or two reels?”
  - “It’s just a recipe video...”
- Prepare for mini mutinies, emotional blackmail, and silent resistance.

### Financial

- Another subscription added, hopefully Netflix & Prime go away

But if you stick to it, it gets easier.

## Advanced Nerd Notes

- **DNS Leak Protection**: Use firewall rules to block outbound port 53 and redirect to OpenDNS.
- **Split VLANs**: For homes with smart TVs and IoT devices, separate them into guest VLANs.
- **Device MAC Tracking**: Some routers let you assign policies per MAC address (for kids vs adults).
- **Dynamic DNS**: If your IP changes often, configure DDNS and bind it to OpenDNS/NextDNS updates.
- **Logs & Analytics**: Use Pi-hole or Netflow on a Raspberry Pi to monitor domain requests for forensic insights.

## Disclaimer

I’m not selling any tool here. This blog is about the **mindset shift** required to raise children in the age of digital dopamine.

Use any tool you prefer. The idea is to build a **secure, distraction-minimal environment** where children grow up watching their parents being intentional — not just entertained.

## Final Words from a Nerdy New Dad

Failing to plan is planning to fail. We’ve baby-proofed our furniture. Now let’s baby-proof our Wi-Fi.

Because the real "parental control" isn’t in a router setting — it’s the decision to take control in the first place. Also do let me know what are your strategies? Did you deny lending your phone?
