# 🗣️ _Back to the Stage_ — My Comeback to Toastmasters and First Visit to Hosur Toastmasters Club

What happens when a **frontend architect meets a podium** after years? You get a mix of `console.log("confidence")` and some seriously good speeches.

I'm **dhbalaji** — Lead Frontend Engineer by day, Toastmaster since 2012, and collector of certificates like [**CC**, **CL**, and **ACB**](/docs/certifications/toastmasters/acb). After taking a break to focus to master sorcerous Javascript. But when I heard there’s a **Toastmasters Club right here in Hosur**, my curiosity wanted me to do a little mic check.

So I walked in. Here's what happened.

## 👀 First Impressions

Having attended clubs with bells, whistles, and near-TED levels of polish, **Hosur Toastmasters** felt refreshingly raw. Think: garage band with talent, waiting to hit Spotify.

### ✅ What Worked:

- **Diverse Professionals:** Engineers, finance folks, HR pros — all under one roof
- **Mature Audience:** 30s+ crowd added depth and real-life stories
- **Warm Vibes:** Received a formal invite ahead of time (yay structure!)

### ⚠️ What Could Be Better:

- **Sunday morning?** Great for early birds, rough for Netflix-bingers
- **Limited networking:** Hybrid format made hallway chats tough
- **Retention Blues:** Noticed some churn — fresh energy needed

The session I attended was a **joint meeting with Proficient Toastmasters Club**, with quite a few tuning in online. Felt like an office teams meeting — but with better grammar.

## 🌟 Meeting Highlights

I won’t pretend I was the General Evaluator, but here’s what stuck with me:

- **Theme:** _“Voices of Nature”_ — poetic, calming, not a weather report
- **Word of the Day:** “**Cacophony**” — ironically, the meeting room fan was anything _but_
- **Prepared Speeches:** Delivered with confidence — definitely mentor material
- **Table Topics:** Real-time adrenaline for guests. I spoke. I survived.
- **TAG Team:** Tracked **Time**, **Ah-counter**, and **Grammar** like ninjas with excel sheets, yes someone ended up sharing screen on teams
- **Evaluations & Awards:** Encouragement with a touch of pageantry and photos
- **Post-Meeting Chats:** Surprisingly rich — could have been better

## 🤔 What Could Level-Up the Experience

Here’s my candid guest audit (no PowerPoint, promise):

- Introduce guests early — helps with context and connection
- Bigger in-person crowd = more energy
- Meeting decorum — a little polish goes a long way
- Tighter meeting flow — less lag between segments
- **Record & upload speeches** — boost visibility and speaker growth

## 💬 People Who Inspired Me

This was the deal-sealer.

Where else do **frontend developers, sales pros, finance strategists, and HR veterans** talk about communication, confidence, and community — all in the same room?

Special shoutout to **TM Muthu Kalimuthu**, the Club President. His hospitality and thoughtful questions before the meeting made me feel like I was already part of the team.
