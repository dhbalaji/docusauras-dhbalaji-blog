## What is Docusaurus

A `react` based static site generator which is modern and developed at `facebook`. Has rss generator, dark theme, navbar and other important parts of a website built in. Ideal for documentation websites and blogs. Has no support for backend integration.

## Most useful parts

Docusaurus has 3 important parts

- documents - useful to show online handbooks
- blog - chronological sequence of articles
- pages - standalone parts of the website

## The hard parts

- Too many options for authoring content. `md`, `mdx` & `react`.
- `preset classic` has lot of bundled plugins, afraid of stepping out of classic preset.
- `swizzle` themes to modify react components of the website.
