<p>Expecting a baby? You’ve probably baby-proofed your furniture, but what about your Wi-Fi and devices? In today’s world, computer networks are as important as cribs and car seats. Here’s how I—a nerdy new dad—secured my digital den for my family’s safety and sanity.</p>

<p>Most homes today have more than one way to get online, even if you don’t realize it. <strong>Computer networks</strong> are everywhere—broadband, mobile data, and hotspots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Internet → ISP Router (Wi-Fi &amp; LAN) → All Devices → your child</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the ISP’s router full control over DNS, firewall rules, and device access. Not ideal for a security-conscious parent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smart phones + data packs → your child</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data packs by carrier don’t give any parental control tools.</p>
<p>We need to target the network-level filtering, which is generally good enough to block ads, parked domains, and time wasters.</p>

Here are <strong>3 classic struggles</strong> that keep popping up, no matter how fast the AI world moves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/senior-junior-51f87aea32a9ab85308c84886b9621b6.webp" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_jvCJ"></p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect"><strong>1. Senior vs. Junior Conundrum – The Banyan Tree Effect</strong><a href="#1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect" title="Direct link to 1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Juniors often feel like they’re <strong>growing in the shadow</strong> of their seniors – those <strong>strong, wide-spread banyan trees</strong> that <strong>block opportunities</strong> and stunt their growth. This isn’t just a theory – data shows that <strong>nearly 30% of techies</strong> with <strong>less than 3 years of experience</strong> switch jobs, looking for <strong>more sunlight and fresh air</strong>.</p>
<p>For juniors, the challenge isn’t just the learning curve but <strong>finding their voice</strong> in a team where the seniors have already taken the best seats. It’s like trying to grow a startup in a market dominated by FAANG.</p>
<p>While seniors are busy debating the <strong>best design pattern for a microservice</strong>, juniors are trying to get their <strong>first pull request merged</strong> without being roasted on the code review thread. It’s a constant game of <strong>&quot;How many comments will this PR get before it’s finally approved?&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;Will anyone mentor me honestly about all corners of the long career ahead?&quot;</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Seniors, on the other hand, see juniors as a <strong>potential threat</strong> – the fresh minds who come in armed with <strong>JavaScript, Python, and React</strong> and casually throw around terms like <strong>LLMs</strong>, <strong>prompt engineering</strong>, <strong>hackathons</strong> and <strong>vector databases</strong>. Meanwhile, the seniors are still perfecting the art of <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>JPA</strong>, occasionally grumbling about how <strong>Java 8</strong> was the last “real” upgrade.</p>
<p>It’s not just about skills – it’s about <strong>mindset</strong>. The seniors have survived <strong>production outages at 3 AM</strong>, managed <strong>political office battles</strong>, and <strong>honestly mentored</strong> a generation of developers who now run startups.</p>
<p>Juniors, on the other hand, are still fresh, living out of <strong>PG rooms</strong>, debugging their code on <strong>15-inch laptops</strong>, and pushing code on a <strong>5G hotspot</strong> while dodging their roommate’s PUBG screams. They may lack experience, but they have the raw <strong>hustle, curiosity, and caffeine tolerance</strong> that seniors often lose along the way.</p>
<p>And if you want a real generational gap, just bring up <strong>Agile vs. Waterfall</strong> in a meeting. The seniors will reminisce about the days when <strong>project plans were thicker than the SRS document</strong>, while the juniors wonder if they should include <strong>Agile Scrum</strong> in their LinkedIn profile.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown"><strong>2. Employee vs. Management – The Cost-Cutting Showdown</strong><a href="#2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown" title="Direct link to 2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to cutting costs, <strong>management</strong> often takes the path of least resistance – <strong>reduce headcount</strong>. Performance, age, location, experience – all fair game when trimming the payroll. This is the <strong>&quot;high-impact, low-cost&quot;</strong> strategy that features in every MBA case study.</p>
<p>From the management perspective, it’s all about <strong>&quot;optimizing the org chart&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot;</strong> – fancy phrases that essentially mean <strong>fewer people, more profit</strong>. The logic is simple: cutting the bottom 10% might save the company <strong>millions</strong> without the <strong>PR disaster</strong> of reducing executive perks.</p>
<p>But employees see it differently. To them, the real savings lie in <strong>cutting the fat at the top</strong>. After all, the <strong>CEO earning 100x</strong> the average developer’s salary, <strong>VPs</strong> flying business class, and middle managers enjoying plush perks attending meetings.</p>
<p>And then there’s the <strong>perks debate</strong>. Employees argue that cutting <strong>free food, and fancy offices</strong> in favor of <strong>WFH (Work From Home)</strong> could save millions. After all, those ping-pong tables and <strong>bean bags</strong> aren’t exactly mission-critical. And let’s be real – the only people who truly use the office gym are the same ones who have the time for <strong>marathon LinkedIn posts</strong>.</p>
<p>This is especially stark in India, where <strong>C-level executives</strong> at top tech firms earn <strong>crores per annum</strong>, while a fresh developer might make <strong>7-15 LPA</strong>. The disparity is not just in the paychecks but also in the <strong>power to decide the fate of others</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities"><strong>3. The Outsourcing Squeeze – A Tale of Two Realities</strong><a href="#3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities" title="Direct link to 3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Outsourcing is a simple idea – move work to a cheaper location and <strong>save big</strong>. India, with its massive pool of <strong>highly skilled engineers</strong>, is a top destination for this. In 2024 alone, India’s <strong>IT exports</strong> were estimated at over <strong>$250 billion</strong>, with <strong>GCCs (Global Capability Centers)</strong> in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai leading the charge.</p>
<p>But this efficiency comes with a human cost. For every American worker laid off, there’s likely a replacement in Bangalore, Manila, or Chengdu doing the same work at a fraction of the cost. It’s the <strong>&quot;rob Peter to pay Paul&quot;</strong> strategy of the corporate world.</p>
<p>But it’s not a bed of roses for the outsourcers either. They’re often stuck in <strong>corporate jungles</strong> – the GCCs of India – doing the same work for <strong>3x-5x less pay</strong> than their Western counterparts, with fewer perks, <strong>less vacation</strong>, and the constant <strong>contract renewal threats</strong>.</p>
<p>And to add to their woes, the <strong>entry-level salaries</strong> at these GCCs have barely moved in the past <strong>15 years</strong>, despite inflation and the rising cost of living. It’s like getting a <strong>static variable</strong> in a <strong>dynamic world</strong>.</p>
<p>Plus, they have to <strong>sync up at 11 PM</strong> for calls with <strong>PST</strong> time zone clients who think that <strong>IST</strong> stands for <strong>&quot;I’ll Slack Tomorrow.&quot;</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This post is a simple <strong>rant for the slump</strong> – not to be taken seriously. There are many more battles in tech, like <strong>open source vs. closed source</strong>, <strong>cloud vs. on-prem</strong>, and <strong>Windows vs. Mac</strong>. I’ll tackle those when the next writer’s block hits. 😉</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_lsmT padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_vOCP"><a rel="tag" class="tag_TErj tagRegular_I0q6" href="/blog/tags/work-life">work-life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_Hr1T"><a href="/blog/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends">Bridging the Gap: CAP Theorem for Senior React Developers</a></h2><div class="container__PQR margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-05-05T15:30:22.000Z">May 5, 2025</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_gWti"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_FrHP" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_xZjf"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_YBhi" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_Wm5l" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_r5cL"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/cap-theorom-git-explained-ff26ca84a5fc10ba511287079503c346.webp" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_jvCJ"></p>
<p><strong>Why this post?</strong> As frontend engineers, we often focus narrowly on frameworks and tooling—primarily JavaScript, React, and UI libraries. But many of us hit a career plateau because we lack exposure to core software engineering principles.</p>
<p>This post is part of a growing genre I call <strong>“Bridge Posts”</strong>—connecting frontend development to foundational software architecture concepts. The goal is to help frontend engineers think like system designers, not just component builders.</p>
<p>Today, we explore the <strong>CAP Theorem</strong>, a classic principle in distributed systems, and map it to familiar frontend scenarios—such as Git workflows, real-time collaborative UIs, and offline-friendly apps.</p>
<hr>

<p>In distributed systems, the <strong>CAP Theorem</strong> states that during a network partition (i.e., some parts of the system can’t communicate), you can only guarantee <strong>two of the following three</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Consistency (C):</strong> All nodes see the same data at the same time.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Availability (A):</strong> Every request receives a response—regardless of the freshness of the data.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Partition Tolerance (P):</strong> The system continues to operate even when parts of it can’t communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, <strong>partition tolerance</strong> is non-negotiable in any distributed system. Therefore, systems must choose between consistency and availability when partitions occur.</p>

<p>Let’s start with Git—a tool every developer knows.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">When you commit locally on a plane, you’re in a <strong>partitioned state</strong>.</li>
<li class="">You can continue working (<strong>Availability</strong>), even though your code may diverge from your teammate’s (<strong>Consistency</strong> is compromised).</li>
<li class="">Once reconnected, you <strong>merge</strong> changes to restore consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Git is an AP (Available + Partition-Tolerant) system</strong>. It tolerates partitions and lets you work offline but eventually requires reconciliation.</p>

<p>Now imagine you’re building a collaborative form in React. Multiple users edit the same form in real-time. Updates are synchronized via WebSockets or polling.</p>
<p>How does CAP play out here?</p>

<ul>
<li class="">If a user loses network connectivity, editing is disabled.</li>
<li class="">This ensures everyone always sees the latest state.</li>

<ul>
<li class="">Users can continue editing offline.</li>
<li class="">Changes are stored locally and synced later.</li>

<p>A <strong>network partition</strong> occurs when different components of a distributed system—clients, services, or databases—cannot communicate due to a temporary network failure. Each component may still be operational, but they&#x27;re isolated like islands without bridges.</p>
<p>In frontend development, this is surprisingly common:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">A user loses internet connectivity mid-session.</li>
<li class="">A mobile app hits a dead spot with no signal.</li>
<li class="">The frontend can reach a CDN or cache but not the main API server.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Designing for Partition Tolerance</strong> means your app should continue functioning as gracefully as possible, even during such disconnects.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="as-a-react-developer-this-involves">As a React developer, this involves:<a href="#as-a-react-developer-this-involves" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to As a React developer, this involves:" title="Direct link to As a React developer, this involves:" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li class="">Storing user actions locally (memory, localStorage, IndexedDB).</li>
<li class="">Queuing mutations and syncing later (e.g., Service Workers, Apollo cache, Redux middleware).</li>
<li class="">Providing clear UI cues: “You’re offline, changes will sync later.”</li>
<li class="">Implementing conflict resolution logic, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Figma</strong> continues rendering and recording user edits during disconnects.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Notion</strong> lets you type offline and syncs the block tree later.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Gmail</strong> stores draft emails offline and sends them once reconnected.</li>
</ul>
<p>These applications <strong>opt for Partition Tolerance</strong>, ensuring the app remains usable—even if consistency is delayed or temporarily broken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing for Partition Tolerance doesn’t mean ignoring consistency—it means accepting that consistency might be <em>eventual</em>, not immediate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In distributed systems, <strong>network failures are not rare edge cases—they&#x27;re expected events.</strong> As frontend engineers, acknowledging and designing for them elevates your thinking from component trees to system-level resilience.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be building a distributed database to care about CAP. If your application:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Caches remote data</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>Lets users work offline</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>Supports multi-user collaboration</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>Relies on eventual consistency</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>…then you’re actively navigating CAP trade-offs.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Can users work with stale data? → Choose <strong>Availability</strong>.</li>
<li class="">Must every write be accurate and conflict-free? → Prioritize <strong>Consistency</strong>.</li>
<li class="">Should the app always respond—even during outages? → Design for <strong>Partition Tolerance</strong>.</li>

<p>Whether you’re building a rich client with React Query, crafting optimistic updates, or designing for offline-first usage, you’re constantly making trade-offs. Understanding CAP helps you make them consciously.</p>
<p>This post was part of a broader mission to elevate frontend engineers into system thinkers—developers who don’t just build buttons, but design resilient user experiences.</p>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the way we build intelligent applications—especially in frontend development. From ChatGPT to custom AI copilots, LLMs are everywhere. But have you ever wondered <strong>how LLMs actually work</strong> under the hood?</p>
<p>The theory behind LLMs can be complex—terms like <em>embeddings</em>, <em>transformers</em>, <em>tokenization</em>, and <em>vector space</em> often feel overwhelming. That’s why I’m using a familiar analogy: a visit to a <strong>local doctor’s clinic</strong>.</p>
<p>This blog post breaks down <strong>the internal architecture of LLMs</strong> using a real-world story that’s easy to visualize and remember. Whether you&#x27;re a developer exploring AI integration, an engineer curious about embeddings, or someone building chat interfaces, this analogy-driven explanation will help you understand:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">What tokenization really means</li>
<li class="">Why vectors and embeddings are essential</li>
<li class="">How transformers &quot;think&quot; using attention</li>
<li class="">Why temperature affects LLM creativity</li>
<li class="">How memory and context shape outputs</li>

<li class=""><strong>Words → Tokens → Vectors → Patterns → Tokens → Words</strong></li>
<li class="">Everything happens in <strong>vector space</strong>, not in &quot;language&quot; as humans know it.</li>

But have you ever considered the power of a <strong>not-to-do list</strong>? It&#x27;s about consciously identifying habits or activities that no longer serve your goals and removing them. Here&#x27;s my not-to-do list for 2025, crafted with the intent to stay focused, efficient, and aligned with my evolving priorities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="1-no-more-public-github-repos">1. No More Public GitHub Repos<a href="#1-no-more-public-github-repos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. No More Public GitHub Repos" title="Direct link to 1. No More Public GitHub Repos" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Open-source contribution has been a cornerstone of the tech world, and I’ve had my share of excitement from it. But with the rise of AI tools, the landscape is changing. Unless you’re a core maintainer of a prominent library, the recognition that once came from showcasing code has diminished.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll shift my energy toward <strong>building meaningful products and functionalities</strong> rather than maintaining a public code showcase. The focus will be on solving problems and creating impact—where the real value lies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="2-no-social-media-overload">2. No Social Media Overload<a href="#2-no-social-media-overload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.

<p>Social media can be a double-edged sword. It’s a goldmine for networking, but it’s also a time sink designed for immersion and doomscrolling. With AI tools providing quick insights (even without sitting through a 40-minute video), my reliance on these platforms will be minimal.</p>
<p>Here’s my plan: <strong>Engage with social media just once a week for an hour</strong>, in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Facebook</strong> for personal updates.</li>
<li class=""><strong>LinkedIn</strong> for professional networking.</li>
<li class=""><strong>GitHub Feed</strong> to track industry trends.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Twitter/X</strong> for niche topics and hot takes.</li>
<li class=""><strong>YouTube Subscriptions</strong> for targeted learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I’ll curate a list of websites to stay updated instead of depending on algorithm-driven feeds.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office">3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office<a href="#3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office" title="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Working from the office puts you into a routine which is a supporting stick for those who lack self discipline of waking up early, switching subjects under work naturally. Thats why I am against working from office on select days of the week.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="4-no-more-reading-goals">4. No More Reading Goals<a href="#4-no-more-reading-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals" title="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I used to pride myself on being a voracious reader, devouring two books a week. But life evolves, and so do habits. For two consecutive years, I failed to hit my reading goals—and that’s okay.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll stop setting rigid reading goals. Instead, I’ll use mobile apps that provide <strong>daily book summaries</strong> to stay updated with the latest titles. Physical books will still have a place in my collection, but the pressure to meet arbitrary goals will be a thing of the past.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="5-no-more-video-courses-unless-ive-tried-and-failed">5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed<a href="#5-no-more-video-courses-unless-ive-tried-and-failed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed" title="Direct link to 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Video courses are everywhere—just one click away. But they often require hours of commitment, and many simply repackage information available in documentation or books.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll treat video courses as a <strong>last resort</strong>. I’ll prioritize <strong>reading documentation</strong>, <strong>experimenting</strong>, and leveraging AI for quick answers. If I still hit roadblocks, only then will I invest time in a course. The same logic applies to interviews or tutorials—AI can summarize key insights faster than a 60-minute watch.</p>

<p>2025 is about <strong>action over abstraction</strong>. Instead of endlessly documenting best practices or creating small libraries, I’ll focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Building real applications</strong> for my portfolio.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Leveraging AI for 5x upskilling</strong>.</li>
<li class="">Prioritizing <strong>actual product development</strong> over pre/post-work content.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to let go of distractions and double down on meaningful work. Here’s to a focused and fulfilling year ahead!</p>

<p>YouTube has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. From entertainment to education, it’s a treasure trove of information waiting to be tapped. However, like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By channeling our time on YouTube towards productive endeavors, we can unlock immense value. Here are three transformative lessons I’ve learned from YouTube in 2024, which have reshaped my perspective and enriched my life.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself">1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself<a href="#1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself" title="Direct link to 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than being technically inclined yet unable to handle minor repairs. For many, minor fixes—whether it’s a laptop issue or a motorcycle—are often overlooked by mechanics or seen as unworthy of their time. Insurance companies don’t cover such small mishaps, and for the owner, they’re just time-wasters. But learning to perform these tasks yourself is a game-changer.</p>
<p>Through YouTube, I’ve gained the confidence to tackle these challenges. DIY repair videos have become my go-to resource before making any major purchases. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Most business-grade laptops have detailed repair tutorials available.</li>
<li class="">Popular vehicles, like Maruti cars, also have a wealth of content explaining common issues and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This newfound skill has transformed how I make purchase decisions. DIY repairability is now a core factor in my selection framework. The ability to fix things with my own hands not only saves money but also fosters a sense of independence and ownership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before buying any big or expensive item, check if it is DIY repair-friendly. It can save you a lot of hassle down the line.</p>

<p>Conversations around finance often revolve around trades, insurance, or IPOs, but rarely delve into overarching financial frameworks or strategies for building wealth. Thanks to YouTube, we can now access diverse perspectives and stories from people at different stages of their financial journey.</p>
<p>Just today, I watched two fascinating videos:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">A story about a betting addict burdened by debt—a cautionary tale of financial mismanagement.</li>
<li class="">The inspiring journey of a top-level executive who retired early to live sustainably on a farm. Their financial strategy included years of disciplined saving and investments, supplemented by income from startups. Here’s their asset allocation:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li class="">40% in real estate, including their farm.</li>
<li class="">40% in equities and mutual funds.</li>
<li class="">10% in gold.</li>
<li class="">10% in liquid funds for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These narratives offer invaluable insights and practical frameworks for managing personal finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Before you quit your job, ensure you have a solid financial runway. Asset allocation is crucial for long-term stability.</p>

<p>For developers and tech enthusiasts, attending global conferences like Next.js Conf or Google I/O often seems like a distant dream. Enter YouTube, the ultimate equalizer. With live streams and recorded sessions, anyone, anywhere, can stay updated on the latest trends and technologies.</p>
<p>This year, I tuned into multiple tech events that would have been impossible to attend in person. These events not only kept me informed but also inspired me to stay ahead in my career. The ability to access these resources at your convenience is a game-changer for lifelong learning.</p>

<p>YouTube is undoubtedly a powerful platform for learning and growth. However, navigating it effectively requires discipline. The abundance of content can quickly lead to doom-scrolling and distractions if we’re not careful. By setting guardrails and focusing on purposeful content, we can turn YouTube into a tool for self-improvement.</p>

<p>Warranty claims in India can feel like navigating the internet with a shaky connection. Sometimes you get a swift <strong>200 OK</strong>, and other times you&#x27;re stuck in an endless loop of <strong>408 Request Timeout</strong> or redirected to <strong>303 See Other Agency for Warranty</strong>. As a tech blogger and frontend developer, I thought it’d be fun to break down this often frustrating yet essential consumer process using HTTP status codes as a metaphor.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="what-the-heck-is-a-warranty">What the Heck is a Warranty?<a href="#what-the-heck-is-a-warranty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?" title="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving in, let&#x27;s understand the basics. Warranty is a form of consumer protection where a company promises to replace or repair a product if it malfunctions within a specified period. Think of it as a service-level agreement between you and the brand, like <strong>12 months of uptime guarantee</strong> for your shiny new &quot;Bonda&quot; mobile charger.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetHideOnScrollNavbar_XFbs" id="but-its-not-always-a-200-ok">But It’s Not Always a <strong>200 OK</strong>...<a href="#but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" title="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>If companies approved every warranty claim without scrutiny, they&#x27;d be out of business. So, they create hurdles to ensure only genuine claims get through. For us consumers, this means our warranty experience can range from seamless to outright bizarre.</p>

<p>Your claim is automatically rejected because you missed the warranty window. Companies rarely extend grace periods, so you&#x27;re on your own now.</p>

<p>Online brands often vanish faster than seasonal discounts. By the time your product fails, the company’s customer support or even the brand itself is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Instead of resolving your claim, companies push you to buy a newer model. It&#x27;s like saying, “Why fix your old phone when you can upgrade to this shiny new one?”</p>

<p>Claiming a warranty in India can be as unpredictable as an HTTP request to a flaky server. From <strong>200 OK</strong> to <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>, your experience depends on the brand, product, and sometimes sheer luck. But with a little preparation and a lot of patience, you can improve your odds.</p>
<p>Remember, warranty claims might not always bring you joy, but at least now you can laugh about them through the lens of HTTP status codes! Hope my article also clarifies if you need to buy extened warranty. That was a good tip if you read till the last line !!.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_lsmT padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_vOCP"><a rel="tag" class="tag_TErj tagRegular_I0q6" href="/blog/tags/products">products</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Technical</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/experience/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Non Technical</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Articles</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/pr-corner">PR Corner</a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Contact me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:balaji@dhbalaji.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink_yOpD"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhbalaji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink_yOpD"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.github.com/dhbalaji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-label="(opens in new tab)" class="iconExternalLink_yOpD"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2026 dhbalaji.dev</div></div></div></footer></div>
