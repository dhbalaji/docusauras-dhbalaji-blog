Throughout my career, I have experienced various moments of significance, and in this blog, I wish to share four events that have shaped my journey.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="embracing-opportunities-the-impact-of-a-tech-conference">Embracing Opportunities: The Impact of a Tech Conference<a href="#embracing-opportunities-the-impact-of-a-tech-conference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Embracing Opportunities: The Impact of a Tech Conference" title="Direct link to Embracing Opportunities: The Impact of a Tech Conference" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>As fate would have it, the most promising opportunities often arise when one is least expecting them. Such was the case when I attended the GIDS conference in 2018. Among the myriad of stalls, Sabre&#x27;s presence caught my attention. Completing intriguing challenges and applying for hiring opportunities, I secured some delightful takeaways from the event. Little did I know that my enthusiasm would lead to a profound connection with the hiring manager, ultimately leading to my employment at Sabre.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="stepping-into-uncharted-territories-the-cultural-shock-of-full-stack-development">Stepping Into Uncharted Territories: The Cultural Shock of Full Stack Development<a href="#stepping-into-uncharted-territories-the-cultural-shock-of-full-stack-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stepping Into Uncharted Territories: The Cultural Shock of Full Stack Development" title="Direct link to Stepping Into Uncharted Territories: The Cultural Shock of Full Stack Development" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Having honed my skills in frontend development, joining Sabre introduced me to an entirely new world of full stack development expertise. The experience proved to be both exhilarating and challenging, as I was entrusted with responsibilities beyond the frontend realm. Despite the initial stress, my foundational knowledge in Java enabled me to navigate through unfamiliar territories with confidence and adaptability.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-challenges-of-brownfield-software-a-lesson-in-agility">The Challenges of Brownfield Software: A Lesson in Agility<a href="#the-challenges-of-brownfield-software-a-lesson-in-agility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Challenges of Brownfield Software: A Lesson in Agility" title="Direct link to The Challenges of Brownfield Software: A Lesson in Agility" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>In the dynamic world of software development, greenfield projects often garner excitement, but the complexities of brownfield issues are seldom met with the same enthusiasm. Overcoming these challenges requires not only technical expertise but also strategic proposals to secure the necessary resources. Adapting to the agile development approach, I learned the significance of addressing outdated software libraries and the importance of proactive solutions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="embracing-new-horizons-the-power-of-internal-job-postings">Embracing New Horizons: The Power of Internal Job Postings<a href="#embracing-new-horizons-the-power-of-internal-job-postings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Embracing New Horizons: The Power of Internal Job Postings" title="Direct link to Embracing New Horizons: The Power of Internal Job Postings" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Throughout my five years, I remained unbound to a single project, exploring different avenues within the organization. This willingness to embrace new opportunities led to a pivotal moment in my career when I received a promotion to lead engineer. Embracing a role within the Enterprise Design Language team, I was immersed in the world of frontend development, which I found to be exhilarating. The experience reinforced the significance of internal job postings, fostering growth and organizational exploration.</p>

<p>As I reflect upon my journey over the past five years, I am reminded of the power of seizing opportunities, embracing change, and striving for growth. Each experience, whether unexpected or planned, has contributed to my professional development, molding me into a more resilient and adaptable individual. With gratitude for the past and excitement for the future, I eagerly await the challenges and triumphs that await in the next chapter of my career.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/2023/4-things-to-know-about-hosur-book-fair">4 things you need to know about The Enthralling Annual Book Fair in Hosur, A Haven for Literature Enthusiasts</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-23T15:30:22.000Z">July 23, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Balaji at Hosur Book Festival&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/at-hosur-book-festival-39c0dfa3ef2bbf132d65bed874bd24ec.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>As an ardent book enthusiast residing in an emerging city, I have often faced the challenge of finding a well-stocked bookstore or literary hub in the vicinity. However, to invigorate our minds and hearts, the residents of Hosur organize an annual book fair that has become a highly anticipated event on our cultural calendar. Having attended this remarkable fair since 2017, I present here four essential aspects that encapsulate its significance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="a-celebration-of-tamil-literature">A Celebration of Tamil Literature<a href="#a-celebration-of-tamil-literature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Celebration of Tamil Literature" title="Direct link to A Celebration of Tamil Literature" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Happening in the heart of Tamil Nadu, the Hosur Book Fair predominantly showcases an impressive collection of books within the realm of Tamil literature. From timeless classics such as Thirukural to masterpieces like Ponniyan Selvan, the fair offers an array of literary treasures that cater to the diverse tastes of the Tamil-speaking populace. A dedicated book store with books related to Periyar, how about that.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="diverse-religious-book-stalls">Diverse Religious Book Stalls<a href="#diverse-religious-book-stalls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Diverse Religious Book Stalls" title="Direct link to Diverse Religious Book Stalls" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>A distinctive feature of the book fair is the presence of stalls dedicated to various religious themes and spiritual pursuits. Visitors can explore bookshelves teeming with Islamic texts, works by Isha Foundation, and other publications centered around religious ideologies. Importantly, these stalls respect the individual choices of visitors, making the experience inclusive and welcoming.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="unearthing-literary-gems-the-used-book-stalls">Unearthing Literary Gems: The Used Book Stalls<a href="#unearthing-literary-gems-the-used-book-stalls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unearthing Literary Gems: The Used Book Stalls" title="Direct link to Unearthing Literary Gems: The Used Book Stalls" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>A true delight for bibliophiles, the fair boasts a fascinating array of used book stalls akin to an adventurous treasure hunt. Many of these stalls offer books previously owned by readers or libraries outside India. The books are sold either by weight or individually at a nominal price of Rs 100 per piece, providing exceptional value for those seeking hidden literary treasures.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-trustworthy-source-authentic-books-from-distributors">The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors<a href="#the-trustworthy-source-authentic-books-from-distributors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors" title="Direct link to The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>In a world rife with counterfeit copies, the book fair stands out as a reliable platform where customers can acquire authentic books directly from esteemed distributors, publishers, and reputable book houses. Unlike some online platforms that occasionally deal in pirated editions, the fair assures visitors of genuine and legally sourced literature. While the prices might marginally exceed those found on certain online retailers, patrons are more than willing to invest in the assurance of authenticity.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The annual Hosur Book Fair has evolved into a remarkable celebration of literature and culture, enchanting the bookworms of the city and beyond. With its emphasis on Tamil literature, diverse religious offerings, captivating used book stalls, and a commitment to genuine publications, this literary extravaganza has etched a special place in the hearts of the attendees. As a devoted visitor, I eagerly look forward to each edition of the fair, for it not only rejuvenates the mind but also fosters a profound appreciation for the world of written words.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/2023/4-pillars-of-financial-success">4 Pillars of Financial Success for Individuals in India</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-06-20T15:30:22.000Z">June 20, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/money-matters-25a14c6e8e8d16eda2faf7cbd2e4ba75.webp" width="1280" height="853" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>In the pursuit of financial success, individuals often dedicate a significant amount of time to consuming financial news, financial literature, minimalist techniques or simply ask their friends for ideas. In this article, we will focus on four essential pillars of financial success for individuals with an Indian background. By following these principles, individuals can strive towards a more secure and prosperous financial future.</p>
<p>By focusing on steady income growth, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and holding long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and build a solid foundation for the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="steady-growing-income">Steady growing income<a href="#steady-growing-income" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Steady growing income" title="Direct link to Steady growing income" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Establishing a steady growing income is a fundamental principle for individuals in India who aspire to achieve financial success. In a country where many middle-class individuals experience limited job growth and security, relying on a single source of income can be precarious. Personally they have to rack up atleast one year worth of expenses in a liquid fund or fixed deposit which I categorize as lazy funds.</p>
<p>Its surprising to see senior advocates, doctors, businessmen making handsome income in their late 80s but a retired engineer making nothing other than his pension if any.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #1: Choosing a retirement proof career is key in financial planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are already mid way through career, start and grow a promising business because business owner cannot be fired or forced to retire by labour laws.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="declining-or-reduced-liabilities">Declining or reduced liabilities<a href="#declining-or-reduced-liabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Declining or reduced liabilities" title="Direct link to Declining or reduced liabilities" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, individuals in India would secure employment within their local communities and often live with extended family or in joint households. Consequently, recurring expenses such as rent, electricity, and locking up money in the form of advances or security deposits were relatively unheard of. However, the modern lifestyle has led to an alarming increase in imprudent accumulation of liabilities. Even before securing employment, individuals often find themselves burdened with education loans, followed by payday loans soon after receiving their first salary. While it is not fair to blame individuals entirely, the expenses associated with metropolitan living necessitate managing multiple financial responsibilities with a limited income, leaving minimal room for savings in their 40s.</p>
<p>Maintaining strong family connections, prioritizing children&#x27;s needs, and preserving cultural traditions can quickly deplete financial resources, making one&#x27;s 30s more challenging than anticipated. Ultimately, achieving financial success requires generating income several times greater than one&#x27;s liabilities. If it proves difficult to substantially increase income, it is imperative to focus on reducing costs and minimizing liabilities. Many successful individuals have chosen to retain modest lifestyles, refraining from upgrading furniture, driving smaller vehicles, and using the same vehicle for extended periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #2: Avoid the shiny, fad and impractical expenses. Think long term before you commit for something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="not-incurring-major-losses">Not incurring major losses<a href="#not-incurring-major-losses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Not incurring major losses" title="Direct link to Not incurring major losses" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the path to wealth creation has always been filled with risks and uncertainties. A notable story from the book &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; recounts an individual who lost their investments due to misguided advice when purchasing gold, resulting in poor decision-making. Today, individuals continue to face similar challenges, often influenced by biased recommendations from stockbrokers, mis-selling insurance agents, and other vested interests. Countless individuals have taken leaps of faith only to discover that their ventures led to significant financial losses, whether through failed businesses or ill-informed investment decisions. Such losses can have long-term consequences on one&#x27;s financial stability and progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #3: In new ventures, Diversify even if the returns are less because losing capital means losing the game of financial success.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="create--holding-long-term-growth-assets">Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets<a href="#create--holding-long-term-growth-assets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets" title="Direct link to Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Anecdotally, we often encounter stories of individuals who achieved substantial wealth by merely leading ordinary lives and retaining inherited ancestral properties. While inheriting wealth is undoubtedly advantageous, those without such fortune must exchange their money for the creation, growth, and retention of assets.</p>
<p>It is essential to recognize that assets need not be limited to gold, stocks, or land. Owning a thriving tea stall in a strategic location that was once neglected but is now a prime spot exemplifies a valuable asset. Many successful family businesses in India trace their roots back to the entrepreneurial efforts of grandparents who fearlessly embarked on ventures that yielded fruitful returns.</p>
<p>Rather than advocating for excessively frugal lifestyles or sacrificing vacations to save money, it is more advantageous to focus on creating assets that can generate significant returns over the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #4: Put time in creating assets instead of trying to save rupees in short term</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The road to financial success is not easy especially when you have a family which includes dependents, a society who pushes new fads like spending 2 lakhs on child first birthday, a govt which introduces taxes on whatever you do and use, a job where growth is like a slow moving train, etc. But good use of money can make you comfortable financially. Its okay to be comfortable than be miserable in terms of money.</p>
<p>Achieving financial success in India requires a combination of discipline, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective. By prioritizing a steady growing income, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and focusing on long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and increase their chances of achieving their financial goals.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/finance">finance</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/2023/4-things-novice-developers-ignore">4 things novice developers ignore and what can be done about it</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-06-14T15:30:22.000Z">June 14, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/lone-developer-f196b935d9ceb51e95624d62931efc36.webp" width="1279" height="854" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>Self-taught individuals, boot camp graduates, mentored professionals, accomplished interns, and dedicated experts are some of the remarkable talents that have joined our workforce. While their technical skills are exceptional, it&#x27;s important to recognize that becoming the best programmer at work entails more than just technical expertise. To make a comprehensive and valuable contribution to our organization, it is crucial to cultivate the following skills:</p>

<p>In the corporate world, even individuals who have been laid off often had a significant workload and a backlog of tasks. This highlights the substantial volume of work within most teams. As new joiners, it is essential to actively and purposefully select assignments that challenge your abilities and contribute to unblocking the team&#x27;s progress. Additionally, identifying tasks that align with your strengths can further enhance your impact.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Being a coder goes beyond the act of pushing code to a repository. It involves reviewing, providing feedback, and improving upon the work done by the team. Many codebases contain sections that have remained untouched for years. By reviewing such code, new joiners can engage in knowledge sharing and take the initiative to improve areas that may be unfamiliar to others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being proficient in reading and understanding others&#x27; code can accelerate your career growth.</p>

<p>The contributions of individual developers often go unnoticed in most teams. Exceptional communication skills are highly valued in such environments. Developers who can effectively communicate, lead engaging meetings, facilitate discussions, and manage virtual interactions are highly sought-after. Remember that meetings are an integral part of corporate life at various levels. Adhering to basic meeting etiquette, actively contributing valuable insights, and making meetings enjoyable can make a significant impact.</p>

<p>Keeping mum and over talking on the job are dangerous.</p>

<p>It is common for young engineers to form friendships within their intern groups, typically with individuals of similar experience levels. However, as young joiners in a professional setting, different expectations apply. Actively engaging with senior engineers and learning from their expertise through close collaboration is essential. Displaying good manners, maintaining a professional demeanor, and exhibiting positive attitudes contribute to professional growth and attract attention within the industry. Simple gestures like a firm handshake, a warm smile, and a proactive attitude establish credibility, respect, and foster positive relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Youre being watched by your peers, behave diligently even when out of office.</p>

<p>Warren Buffett is a renowned investor who has made a fortune by investing in undervalued companies. He is also known for
his wit and humor. One of his most famous quotes is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who&#x27;s been swimming naked.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote, which was originally intended for investors, is also applicable to corporate employees. Not long ago, we
experienced a period of rapid hiring, with employees receiving multiple offers and corporations going on a hiring spree.
During this time, employees were able to negotiate favorable terms, such as high salaries, compensation packages, and
positions. However, economic cycles are real, and eventually, companies become overstaffed and their financial results
suffer. As a result, companies begin to lay off employees.</p>
<p>The quote &quot;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who&#x27;s been swimming naked&quot; is a reminder that economic conditions
can change quickly, and that companies need to be prepared for downturns. When the economy is strong, it is easy to get
caught up in the excitement and make decisions that are not sustainable in the long run. However, when the economy
turns, companies that have been overextended will be the ones that suffer the most. The employees at these companies
will suffer the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2023 is the year of right-sizing companies, and it is having a significant impact on Indians working in multinational
corporations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The media and press have been reporting on layoffs, and this has created a sense of anxiety and uncertainty among
employees. When a common person meets a techie, they often inquire about their job security. The abbreviation &quot;CFBR&quot; is
also becoming increasingly common on LinkedIn. This stands for &quot;Commenting For Better Reach,&quot; and it refers to the
practice of commenting on posts from people who are looking for work.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that are contributing to the right-sizing of companies. These include the global economic
slowdown, the rise of automation, and the increasing competition from emerging markets. As a result of these factors,
many companies are finding it necessary to reduce their workforces.</p>
<p>The right-sizing of companies is having a significant impact on Indians working in multinational corporations. Many
employees have been laid off, and those who remain are facing increased pressure to perform. The job market is also
becoming more competitive, as more and more people are looking for work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="observations">Observations<a href="#observations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Observations" title="Direct link to Observations" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Here are your observations about right sizing and how to mitigate risk, in a more professional tone:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="there-is-no-good-news">There is no good news<a href="#there-is-no-good-news" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to There is no good news" title="Direct link to There is no good news" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Right-sizing, or downsizing is the process of reducing the size of a company&#x27;s workforce. This can be done through
layoffs, attrition, or a combination of the two. Right-sizing can be a difficult decision for companies, but it is often
necessary in order to remain competitive.</p>
<p>There is no good news for employees who are affected by right-sizing. The job market is already competitive, and
right-sizing can make it even more difficult to find a new job. In addition, right-sizing can have a negative impact on
the morale and productivity of the employees who still remain with the organizations.</p>
<p>Most companies are not actively hiring during this economic downturn.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-education-material-may-not-help-you-greatly">The Education material may not help you greatly<a href="#the-education-material-may-not-help-you-greatly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Education material may not help you greatly" title="Direct link to The Education material may not help you greatly" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Right-sizing can lead to an increase in demand for education and training. Employees who are laid off may need to
upskill or re-skill in order to find new jobs. However, the education sector may not be able to keep up with the dynamic
market nature.</p>
<p>In addition, employers may be reluctant to hire employees who have only recently completed education or training. They
may prefer to hire employees who have deeper experience in the field.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="everything-looks-scary-generative-ai--self-doubt">Everything looks scary, Generative AI &amp; Self Doubt<a href="#everything-looks-scary-generative-ai--self-doubt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Everything looks scary, Generative AI &amp; Self Doubt" title="Direct link to Everything looks scary, Generative AI &amp; Self Doubt" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Right-sizing can be a very stressful experience for employees. It can lead to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and
fear. In addition, employees may start to doubt their own abilities. They may worry that they will not be able to find a
new job, or that they will not be able to find a job that is as good as their old one.</p>
<p>Generative AI and other new technologies can also add to the stress of right-sizing. These technologies can make it
easier for companies to replace employees with machines. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and obsolescence.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="multiple-rounds-of-layoff-disturb-morale-at-work">Multiple rounds of layoff disturb morale at work<a href="#multiple-rounds-of-layoff-disturb-morale-at-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multiple rounds of layoff disturb morale at work" title="Direct link to Multiple rounds of layoff disturb morale at work" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Right-sizing can have a negative impact on morale at work. Employees who are laid off may feel betrayed and resentful.
In addition, employees who remain may be worried about their own job security. This can lead to a decrease in
productivity and an increase in turnover. Both physical and mental health will suffer.</p>

<p>There is no surefire way to avoid being laid off. However, there are some things that employees can do to increase their
chances of surviving right-sizing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Join a profitable company. Employees are more likely to be laid off from companies that are struggling financially.
Therefore, it is important to join a company that is profitable and has a good reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that your work has a business value. Employees who do work that is essential to the company&#x27;s operations are
less likely to be laid off. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your work is valuable to the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a valuable asset to the company. Employees who are valuable assets to the company are less likely to be laid
off. This means being able to do more than one thing, being able to work independently, and being able to think
outside the box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be positive and proactive. Employees who are positive and proactive are more likely to be seen as valuable assets to
the company. They are also more likely to be able to find new jobs if they are laid off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a financial cushion. Employees who have a financial cushion are less likely to be stressed out if they are laid
off. This means having enough money saved up to cover your expenses for at least six months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace rightsizing as part of career and plan accordingly. Avoid spending on lifestyle inflation like a fancy car,
flat, etc. Instead, spend time on marketing yourself like personal website, network, etc. Employees have a shelf life
like any other commodity.</p>

<p>Sure, here are some myths related to right sizing in tech companies, along with some clarifications:</p>
<p><strong>Myth 1</strong>: Young and low-level engineers are exempted during right sizing.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Everyone is examined through a different lens, regardless of experience level or position. In some cases,
young
and low-level engineers may be more likely to be laid off, as they may be seen as less essential to the company&#x27;s
operations. However, this is not always the case, and there are many factors that companies consider when making layoff
decisions. No department is safe during right sizing including human resources and accounting.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 2</strong>: Seniors and managerial staff are most hit during right sizing.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: While managerial staff layoffs and top level exits are widely discussed. In fact, in some cases, companies may
choose to retain managerial staff in order to maintain continuity and leadership during a time of change.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 3</strong>: Contractors will be let go first.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Contractors will be impacted, but they are not always let go first during right sizing. In some cases,
companies may choose to retain
contractors in order to finish the ongoing projects. Once the work is done, their contracts may not be extended.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 4</strong>: Companies cut all the extra costs before considering right sizing employees.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: While companies may try to cut costs in other areas before laying off employees, this is not always possible.
The fancy pantry, expensive office buildings will still operate with some modifications.
In
some cases, the only way for a company to remain profitable is to lay off employees.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 5</strong>: Jobs cut in high-cost centers are moved to low-cost centers.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: This is not necessarily true. While companies may sometimes move jobs to lower-cost centers, this is not
always
possible or feasible. In some cases, the only way for a company to remain profitable is to lay off employees in all
locations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these are just some of the myths related to right sizing in tech companies. The specific
factors that companies consider when making layoff decisions will vary from company to company.</p>

<p>To sum up, right-sizing can be a very stressful experience for employees. It can feel like a runtime exception at work,
where everything is suddenly thrown into chaos. However, by following the tips above, employees can increase their
chances of surviving right-sizing and finding a new job.</p>
<p>Only during right sizing activities we realize the value of money and time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/custom-email-address">How I created functional custom google domains email address &quot;balaji@dhbalaji.dev&quot;</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-05-14T18:30:22.000Z">May 14, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the story behind functional custom email address <code>balaji@dhbalaji.dev</code></p>

<p>The custom email addresses look more professional on the resume or back of the truck, hope you got my point. I have seen all sort of weird email addresses on the resume like <code>sureshnaidu1929@gmail.com</code> but the improved version would be <code>contact@suresh.dev</code></p>

<p>I am not going to pen down every step in this process, instead I will share valuable blog posts which <a href="https://alexlenail.medium.com/i-want-to-send-emails-from-my-google-domains-email-through-gmail-992bb3eae4c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I referred and grateful for</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a technical one.</p>
<p>a. Set up email forwarding by following <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251241?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google documentation</a>.</p>
<p>b. You will not create a new gmail inbox but add an alias to the gmail. The gmail UI will show
a select dropdown with newly added custom domain</p>

<p>As an interviewer, I have seen a wide variety of resumes, from one-page to eight-page tomes. Very few resumes are well-written and impressive, while others are just lengthy documentation. Some resumes are difficult to read while others have information hidden inside paragraphs of text.</p>
<p>However, the best resumes are those that are visually appealing infographics which are easy to glance and understandable by the interviewer in under 10 seconds. Remember, less is more when you try to make an impression through words and copywriting.</p>
<p>If you are serious about marketing yourself, I encourage you to invest time in creating a catchy infographic resume. This type of resume can be a great way to stand out from the competition and show potential employers that you are creative and innovative.</p>
<p>I recently created a few infographic resumes, and I was even awarded by Canva for my iterative design work on my resume which happened because of my unsettling design spirit. If you would like some help creating your own infographic resume, I would be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>The tool which I recommend for creating infographic is <code>Canva</code>. To understand how to make infographic resumes work for you, read the book &quot;The Infographic Resume: How to Create a Visual Portfolio that Showcases Your Skills and Lands the Job by Hannah Morgan&quot;</p>
<p>The book &quot;The Infographic Resume: How to Create a Visual Portfolio that Showcases Your Skills and Lands the Job by Hannah Morgan&quot; does a good job of presenting multiple infographic resumes written by candidates holding diverse job profiles like accounting, senior management, etc.</p>

<p>Post covid, I do not attend in person meetings. Hey Covid, you added bunch of excuses to the list. I do not use Groww app however I decided to attend this meeting to hear the financial jargon. This meeting was first of its kind, a meeting about finances is not something that happens often in upcoming cities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="venue-and-arrangements">Venue and arrangements<a href="#venue-and-arrangements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Venue and arrangements" title="Direct link to Venue and arrangements" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The venue was in district headquarters or Taluk. The hotel was in a decent location, well-connected to all means of transport. Event had adequate branding arrangements. Not too flashy or the absence of it.</p>
<p>There was a small stage suitable for one speaker to stand and present his contents to a room of 50 to 75 people.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/groww-stage-eb02adef443b71bfbbd6e3b734a3529e.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>I reached the venue first, and it was an empty room but towards the end, the hall was full.</p>

<p>Free tickets were to be booked on eventbrite platform in advance.</p>
<p>The room had people who where in their teens until retirement. I think the Groww team estimated the audience demographic details by their experience. They had a certified financial planner to give a financial talk for close to 1.5 hours.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="speaker">Speaker<a href="#speaker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speaker" title="Direct link to Speaker" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>His name is Karthik, and he is a CFA. Because that&#x27;s all we know about him. There was hardly any speaker introduction or hype or welcome address.</p>
<p>The speaker also did not do PR for Groww. The speaker maintained a neutral view without being sales focused.</p>

<p>The general purpose of a speech presented by the CFP would essentially be around having a financial plan in place, identifying goals and arranging corpus for goals. The speaker delivered a well crafted speech backed by research and data.</p>
<p>Let me present the unique points apart from stock selection theory, retirement planning, investment choices which were spoken on the stage.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="comparing-similar-stocks-before-buying">Comparing similar stocks before buying<a href="#comparing-similar-stocks-before-buying" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Comparing similar stocks before buying" title="Direct link to Comparing similar stocks before buying" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Let us assume you are an informed investor. You would select a sector, then industry, and then the stock. But have you compared the stock pick with the peers thoroughly? I do not do that because I know only about company X and not its peers.</p>
<p>The simplest way to compare would be to use screener website peers table or make your own table with key KPI and access the peers closely. We might pick a better stock in this approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average SIP tenure is about 3 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen the fancy Groww SIP calculator throwing 8 figures when you input a decent SIP number and 15 years of tenure but how many really get to realize the numbers? Not many of us, because markets are volatile, scary and nerve wrecking when the corpus gets bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short term the market generates losses but in a period of 10+ years the chances of market investment making losses is very low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An average investor tends to take the money out of MF or stop the SIP process. This is preventing people from becoming crorepati.</p>
<p>The assumption is that you invest your money into flexi cap fund or some evergreen funds which are professionally managed. Mutual funds can be compared to market performance. If the MF is consistently underperformed for multiple years in a row in spite of markets going upwards, then you may have to switch the MF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High P/E stocks essentially means that in case of crash, it would take longer time to recover from the crash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The speaker did not say mutual fund sahi hai at all. The speaker was an advocate of tagging an investment to a goal. Tagging investment to a goal relieves the investor from emotional conundrums like should I take my money out or should I worry about the crash, etc.</p>
<p>Let us say you are saving for child college, then the ripe time to think of withdrawing money would be 3 years before college. Withdrawal can be done in SWP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As long as the financial goal is met, the investment vehicle hardly matters.</p>
