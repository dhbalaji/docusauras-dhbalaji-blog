<p>Live demonstrations showcased GenAI&#x27;s capabilities. Notably, the creation of a shopping cart app with star ratings on both frontend and backend required only a few prompts.</p>
<p><strong>VS Gemini vs. Code Assist Addon</strong></p>
<p>While both tools generate code, Gemini offers a key advantage: it can learn and generate code for new or less common libraries on-the-fly, surpassing limitations of pre-trained languages.</p>

<p>The objective of this post is to summarize the key points discussed in React Nexus 2024 conference in 100 points. I call them good parts of React Nexus 2024. I add my commentary along the way. Hope you like it and read all the way from good parts #1 to #100.</p>

<li>
<p>The selection of <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#venue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Nexus 2024 Venue</a> was Apt, not just easy for attendees but also in line with react nexus 2023 venue. Radison Blu Marathahalli is our 2 day adda (means a social gathering or hangout spot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rockstars of the conference, the speakers were simply meritorious and profound. The full list along with their linkedin and X handles can be found on <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Nexus Speakers Section</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference vibe was kindled by a giant screen resembling a movie theatre and JBL speakers playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA-ChrNuyO0&amp;pp=ygUPZGVlcCBkb3BlIG11c2lj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep dope beats</a>. Further momentum was added by <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#mcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charismatic emcees</a> who knew tech and humour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference goodies included an name card tag, tshirt which is true to its size variant and few stickers. Minimalistic and useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall conference was jam packed with surprises like traditional yakshagana dance, activities which felt like cardio &amp; desk yoga, standup comedy, Bhangra dance which resembled flash mob, timely coffee and great food.</p>
</li>

<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>The first speaker was Naman Goel, spoke about &quot;Designing for design: API decisions for long-term success&quot;. Naman is a maintainer at <a href="https://stylexjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleX JS</a> at Meta. He spoke about the design decisions, importance of inspiration and lineage in developing libraries and quick demos of stylex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish your side project to be successful. I do not think this needs any explaination. Simple advice yet profound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React was inspired by functional programming so hooks were inevitable and a natural progression. The same inspiration is a hidden force in stylex JS as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of ReactJS be like.. React create class --&gt; JSX --&gt; Real classes --&gt; Functional Components --&gt; hooks --&gt; React server components..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conference talk idea. &quot;Algebraic effects&quot;. This is a react concept which is discussed on <a href="https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Blog</a> and referenced in Naman Goel speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade offs help us to reach the sweet spot in design decisions. I cant agree more, without tradeoff programming would be simply hard for many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React fiber underwent a complete rewrite 8 years ago due to which we are able to add further enhancements to React like hooks, React Server Components (RSC), etc. Its always a good value add to hear directly from maintainers at Meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second speaker Nurul Sundarani, spoke about &quot;Beyond the Backend: The Rise of React Server Components&quot;. He gave a lightning introduction to React Server Components (RSC in short) and how we can use them with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the era of RSC, every frontend developer will be a fullstack developer too. Tools like Prisma should help you with that transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSC can directly talk to databases, render only on the server so they can have API keys, good for SEO as the HTML and CSS alone can add value to the web crawlers, make the website quick by avoiding render fetch, etc.. The list goes on. Bottomline learn RSC ASAP. Good for you and your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third speaker Akash Hamirwasia, spoke about &quot;Enhancing your Static Sites with React Server Components&quot;. Yes, RSC can be used on the static website. Sounds contrary? then read on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://akashhamirwasia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Static websites</a> too run on a server and RSC can make use of the file server to do more. I was not able to find the code on Speaker Github but you need to know that its a possibility to do RSC on static websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was impressed with ease and confidence with which the relatively young speaker Akash was able to put his point across the room. While I was watching his speech, I was convinced without a doubt. Bottomline, the speaker had exceeding levels of communications skills and confidence. Sometimes you pick up a thing or two non tech skills in a tech conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Stefinie Fernando spoke about &quot;Building Secure React Apps with Choreo IDevP&quot;. The software Choreo had some similarity with GCP app engine. In choreo the role of the developer ends with commiting code and packaging app into a image. The rest is taken care by Choreo platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Choreo platform boasts of complete software development cycle support ranging from CI/CD to deployment on a cluster. To playaround, visit <a href="https://wso2.com/choreo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choreo website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next JS which is a react framework has good levels of RSC support. Other react frameworks like remix are not behind. Think RSC, think react frameworks. RSC have friends too, they are called React server actions. <code>use server</code> directive, heard of it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If there were one word that was repeated a lot during react nexus 2024, it would be RSC</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22">
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Vamshi Suram spoke about &quot;Scalable mock data injection into Apollo (GraphQL) Client&quot;. Overall the speaker was confortable on stage talking about his open source project <a href="https://github.com/intuit/apollo-mock-http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apollo-mock-http</a> which helps us with data mocking even in enterprise level applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mocking should be done away from application layer so that they can be toggled with a feature switch. This is not advice specific to apollo client but frontend in general. I like this application design pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good mocking should not hinder or interfere with UI rendering because you loose out on the UI interactivity and animation. This advice is given with the context of react components where devs set data to props directly to mock the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fifth speaker Sweta Tanwar spoke about &quot;Defensive Development: Testing Tactics for React Native Resilience&quot;. This was the first speech referencing React Native in React Nexus 2024. The content was actionable and could easily be blown up into a full book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defensive application development can be broken into 3 categories. Code practices, Testing and CI/CD automation. More details in the next thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code practices include code quality checks, error handling with graceful degradation and error boundaries, component isolation before testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing practices include Unit testing with Jest, Integration testing with Enzyme and E2E testing with Detox/Appium. On react we are mostly talking about React testing with Vitest and playwright testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pyramid visualization was used to show that an app needs more unit tests which are efficient and integration testing at the top of the pyramid which are comprehensive. The pyramid slide will be referenced in my future discussions with architects on why unit, e2e and integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD automation of tests can be done to catch regression issues in a automated fashion. We can use tools like circle CI, Travis, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sixth Speaker Rajat Vijay spoke about &quot;Experiments with AI-Generated Tests&quot;. I see the testing theme, pre lunch to be a good idea. Good job organizers. I can sense that Rajat has seen good amount of tests in his career. He clearly outlined the problem with Copilot generated tests and how he intends to fix them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat mentioned a tool titled &quot;auto guardian&quot; which instructs AI tools about the expected quality and style of testing. It looks like a config file for AI testing. I feel this would bring uniformity in the AI testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat spilled a few interview questions. userEvent vs fireEvent? Whats the difference and which is better. getByRole vs getByText. I will write a blog about these topics soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat referenced <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.promptingguide.ai/</a> to understand more about writing better prompts. I believe the future auto guardian would refer to these prompting standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testing demo was fun to watch and clearly the quality of tests can be increased greatly. The link to github repo is broken. Rajat plz toggle the repo to public if its private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seventh speaker were from freshworks, spoke about &quot;AI-Assisted Development: Harnessing the Freshworks Freddy Copilot Toolkit for App Development&quot;. The second sponsor speech on day 1. Its interested to see the no code movement gaining steam. Developers can build a full fledged application with a few apps and monetise on the platform. Thats insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Freedy Copilot had lot of similarities with github copilot. It needed registration, installation on vs code, type your requirement on chat. Freedy can also deploy to their marketplace. Finally no code app generation is in reach / at times free to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The different stages from an idea to app. Requirements gathering, design, implemenation &amp; refactoring, testing can be handled by Freedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedy can also build UI for the developers based on the prompt. frontend engineers, gulp it down. Yes AI can build UI. Freedy relies on vision models for generating UI for freshworks marketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The engineering behind Freedy copilot was also discussed by second presenter Nagaraj. All I could injest into my mind were LLM, AI and more of it. Finally Day 1 Lunch hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post lunch first session featured a panel discussion comprising none other than the react core team from meta, how cool is that. We had Satya talk about the working on React compiler. Yes I heard it for the first time. I know only about React fiber but React compiler is a thing. True to its name, it compiles your react app into something sophisticated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The react compiler could potentially free us from writing useMemo and useCallback as the compiler could do better code optimization compared to a normal developer. However if the compiler identifies a tricky code or hacky code, it will assume that developer is the best judge and shall not mess with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In React 19, ref is a regular prop. I hope to miss forwardExoticComponentRef in my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a short and sweet answer to breaking changes, if you had been following the modern standards of react development. Then there are no breaking changes that should bother you. So legacy app developers brace yourself, modern app developers rejoice and upgrade to react 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eslint plugin for react is now updated and optimized for react compiler. However there are many bugs that could escape the eslint and get inferred by React compiler. Code better and do not just trust eslint for react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React Strict DOM (RSD) is an integration of React DOM and StyleX, aiming to streamline and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native targets. We had Stylex maintainer Naman Goel talk about the possibilities of RSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversation quickly moved towards RSC (React Server Components) best practices. Don&#x27;t waste time hydrating components that are not read/used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Render as you fetch or fetch as you render? An another interview question to note. The panel favoured Render as you fetch as mentioned this is how apps to be built be it RSC or RN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use operator is used for reading resources outside of the render. However it being a panel discussion, no demo or code was shown about the use operator. An another speech topic for potential speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road ahead for react team looks like this. Compilation improvements, eslint plugin updates, lot of tooling related work is expected. I remember panel mentioning NextJS, Remix, etc. The panel discussion felt short but Tapas (the moderator) was well prepared with sharp questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eighth speaker Prateek Surana spoke about &quot;Elevate your routing game with TanStack Router&quot;. Definitely I felt slightly outdated or an idiot for not use tanstack router after his demo. The power and relevance for enterprise use cases were amazing and would prevent developers from reinventing the wheel around routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tanstack router is file based, which is easy to understand and relatively hard to scale. To me the most killer feature was auto filter param rename in runtime. Let us say if param was misspelled, tanstack query can correct it for us without breaking the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall tanstack tools are squarely built around scaled react usecases which is beyond a simple ecommerce use case. I recommend checking out other tanstack tools and I am also excited to see how the tanstack fullstack comes out to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nineth speaker Palak Bansal spoke about &quot;Mastering Image Optimization Techniques for Web Performance in React Applications&quot;. Let us face it, images can be hard to optimize and Addy osmani has written a book about it. Palak rightly hit the nail on the head by telling &quot;Best practices keep changing which makes image optimization harder&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadly there are 3 image optimization techniques that were discussed. They are lazy loading, responsive  images and image CDN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lazy loading can be done on the <img> tag with a attribute called lazy. The responsive images can be based on width of the client or pixel density of the client. Image cdn can be self managed or third party cdn which generate images on the fly specially for the client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are wondering if the talk around image optimization is not as comprehensive as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/image-optimization-pre-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addy Osmani</a> book, you are right. This is a small talk format, some speeches are smaller than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenth speaker Jerad Rutnam spoke about &quot;Simplify React App Login&quot;. The reasons for having a login feature are access control and personalization. But having a solid authentication logic can be hard and there were the sponsor of the event pitched his humble React component which was part of <a href="https://wso2.com/asgardeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asgardeo sdk</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of Asgardeo team, the recommendation from Jerad was to delegate complex parts of the app and focus on business logic implementation which could be your goto market strategy. Cannot deny if everyone had good budget, flexibility in the code and restrictions around data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eleventh speaker Apurv Khare spoke about &quot;Flashpoint Performance&quot;. Is that even a thing or library or concept? Before I could stop wondering, the speaker was sprinting at the speed of flash with his speech. Lots of concepts discussed and I had tough time writing down the ideas from his speech. But the speaker knew his tools and he explained with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure performance first and optimize later. The speaker took us through different categories of performance metrics like Browser metrics, Core web vitals, Lab data &amp; Field data. The optimization techniques include compression techniques, optimizing JS, optimizing CSS, resource hints and optimized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker idea was to give a crash course on measure performance and also optimizing the performance with some numbers/reports from the tools wherever required. But I do not think the speaker showed us any tool called flashpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browser metrics - Time To First Byte (TTFB), Speed Index. Core web vitals / User experience metrics - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Latest Shift (CLS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here are some of the tools to measure website performance. App run at lab condition / lab data - Lighthouse, webpage test. App run at field condition / field data - Chrome UX report (CrUX), Pagespeed insights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network waterfall was well discussed with webpageTest and web vitals were discussed. The important performance concept, Critical Rendering Path was discussed. Of course, the speaker mentioned how CSSOM is built and how its different from JS DOM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website performance testing on first load vs repeat load was interesting to me because we generally measure the first load only. Wherever flat text files or documents are served from server to client, we must enable one of the gzip, brottli or other compression techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For optimizing JS - Pause blocking JS, defer it as much as possible. For Optimizing CSS - download CSS ASAP on the device in one chunk so that CSSOM gets built and the user can see the content rendered. Use resource hints like rel, as to pre load the content before it gets used. When prefetching multiple resources, use fetch priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day 1 post noon, performance speeches continue. The 12th speaker and last speaker of the day was Saurabh Daware and he spoke about &quot;Debugging Performance Issues of Your Website&quot;. The previous speech was theoretical and this speech was practical to the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance issues are like any other bugs, for debugging performance issues just do not put a break point. The first place to look for is the network waterfall whenever we face an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker was running a static site featuring Razorpay landing page, he demonstrated First Contentful Paint and Last Contentful Paint. The speaker attempted to showcase perceived performance optimization and how his attempted interfered with other metrics like LCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker showcased how he cleverly chose to improve the perceived performance by booting the webcontainer only when code gets focus, until that point he shows the static output which gives the user the perception of fast. Its kind of fake it until you make it logic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="day-2-of-react-nexus-2024">Day 2 of React Nexus 2024<a href="#day-2-of-react-nexus-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024" title="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ol start="72">
<li>
<p>Day 2 felt somewhat slow to me as we did not waste time at registration desk. But things took a turn when we begun the day 2 with a lightening talk about Yoga. The speaker gave a mini talk focussed on breathing, expanding spine length and some posture correction tips. We need to take 10 minutes a day to see the difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key exercises mentioned were neck stretches, breathing slow and deep, shoulder roll, cat cow pose while sitting. If you are yoga geek, then Tadasana and Garudasana were mentioned. If you feel stiff like wood, then remember range of motion increases with consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 13th speaker Alex Lobera spoke about &quot;Future-proofing state management at scale&quot;. He showcased the app he works on &quot;Miro&quot; and there is definitely lot of user state, sync state happening in the app. The app looks like scrum board and renders on canvas/webGL based on the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author somehow connected the PHP era with RSC era. We were essentially connecting to DB and building UI all in one php file. We are doing the same in RSC. Just the server was not in the picture during SPA era and now its back. Congrats, everyone is now a full stack engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client can access server state but server cannot access client state. The server is coming back to the picture, this time its different. The server can help us build a state in RSC era. fyi day 2 had lot of speakers flying into India for the conference. Alex was from Portugal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 14th speaker Tapas Adhikary spoke about &quot;Do You Really Need React Query For Your Applications?&quot;. I was one of the user of React Query and I got hooked. The real threat to React Query was change in context due to RSC. Now the client can talk to DB directly. However for complex use cases we might still need tanstack query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 15th speaker K Kamalakannan spoke about &quot;Simplifying Complex Logic: Leveraging XState in React Development&quot;. I appreciate the state machine part, orchestration and visualization aspect of XState.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th speaker Ankit Tailor spoke about &quot;How I built a Powerful Typed System?&quot;. He had worked on a design sytem called gluestack where he has authored CSS in JS which needs to be type safe. I could appreciate the use case for generic data types in designing type systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker mentions different aspects of DX like linting, debugging tools, typescript type checks and he showcased a CLI diagnostic tool which could show the size of generated types file which is absolutely needed for performance reasons. npx tsc --diagnostics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th and 17th speaker were Mike Grabowski &amp; Eric Vicenti speaking about a new paradigm &quot;How you can Server-Render without Rendering on the Server&quot;. At the core we are trying to use web sockets to communicate with client UI on realtime to render changes. The use case was showcases interactively like a theatre play by 2 speaker on the stage with live coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speakers showcased their npm component library which could react to our code listening via WS protocol. The links to the code or library cannot be found on google. Watch out for <a href="https://rise.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rise.tools</a>. Not just the rendering library, rise.tools also has a component library so that developers can quickly build apps along with a playground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 18th speaker Sanket Sahu spoke about &quot;Building Back-End Driven Universal Apps&quot;. Conceptually Sanket is attempting to solve the same problem as Mike &amp; Eric. Instead of too much code which looks like config. We have syntactically simpler code which can be generated by chatgpt to a very high level of accuracy. Thats in line with no code development of the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 19th speaker Shruti Arya spoke about &quot;Measuring UI performance at scale&quot;. The talk was mostly about React native app on low end android devices. The github project was called component-profiler. Surprisingly I could not catch hold of the link to it. The goal was to prevent long re-renders so that there is no jankiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 20th speaker Santosh Yadav spoke about &quot;Improve your Developer Experience with Nx&quot;. When the pain point that Nx tries to fill was lengthy build times on any machine, be it CI/CD or cloud or local. The NX tool intelligently creates a graph of the code and precisely knows the impact of the code change. Then runs the required build tasks instead of running every single build step on the entire code base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 21st speaker Apoorv Taneja spoke about &quot;Creating beautiful experiences with Framer-Motion on web&quot;. <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framer motion</a> helps anyone without indepth css knowledge build animations. The speaker precisely showed us how to use framer to create interactivity on the UI components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 22nd speaker Yashpreet Bathla spoke about &quot;Avoid flickering user interfaces&quot;. The presentation deck resembled windows 95 and it was amazing. The speaker explained the concepts like call stack, micro task queue, macro task queue and render queue in detail. He also mentioned the need to maintain 60FPS, and one render in 16.6ms to have a jank free interface. He also showed how using useLayoutEffect helps in preventing jankiness when compared to useEffect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 23rd speaker Mohit Kumar Toshniwal spoke about &quot;Building XR applications using React Three Fiber&quot;. As speaker rightly said, the AR/VR usage has increased. Be it shopping on amazon or navigating with google maps. We can build AR/VR apps in react with react three fiber, drei, leva, react-xr etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then a panel discussion follows but this time the theme is state of react native. Panelists mentioned that react native is yet to reach v1.0.0. The expo eco system is quite mature and visiting expo.new is the way to get started with React native.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 24th speaker Neha Sharma spoke about &quot;Connecting Worlds: Enhancing Accessibility in React Native TV Applications&quot;. Her talk was more about building accessible react native apps for smart TVs. On the mobile, the accessible is missing unlike accessible semantic html. This calls for more empathy from react native developers. The attributes like accessible are must have to make app accessible on TVs. The speaker reiterated that accessiblity is hard, its not a requirement but a feature to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 25th speaker Siddharth Kshetrapal spoke about Building accessible reusable react components. Having worked at primer.style, he is proficient in comprehending accessiblity issues and uses his tech speaker skills to make it interesting and understandable to audience. The speaker used 2 commonly used github widgets and tried to make them accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Siddharth referenced the importance of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APG</a> over WCAG in some use cases. he cleverly used the voice over to illustrate the pain, which the disabled people undergo due to our incorrect coding. I was thrilled and hooked to this speech, will certain share this speech to A11 enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I watched the react documentary trailer for the first time and happy to see the people behind React and the collective team spirit. You should watch it too, I mean the full video on youtube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;How A Small Team of Developers Created React at Facebook | React.js: The Documentary&quot;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsors were unintrusive, I was not bored by their presence on the stage or at the booth. Both of them answered the questions earnestly. The Freedy developer, aka AI tool for freshworks marketplace developers booth at the conference was showering goodies to the successful quiz winners and they had a lucky draw too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Asgardio platform which is a simple managed Authentication platform for developers conducted a workshop post the day 1 session which I felt was a generous  offering for attendees. The choreo platform which was an another stall was a useful utility for individual developers and small teams who want to have managed backend service. I love their stickers and pens kept for visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience were diverse in terms of demographics and their roots. Some of them were from students at Scalar academy, managers at Microsoft, founders of companies and in between. The Javascript community is quite strong like a giant multinational company having its subsidaries for their interests. We have JS Lovers, Chennai React, Delhi React, React Day Bangalore, team shiksha, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emcee Jobs are hardest and demands Charisma. Aakansha Doshi was simply bold and energetic. The cardio session to beat the sleep was a masterstroke by Aakansha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From timely humor to manager jokes, the second emcee Sahil Kalyani was equally charismatic on the stage. The third emcee Yashraj Nayak, whom I would remember for &quot;how is the josh&quot; was unique. He had deep connections with speakers and he was able to discuss some enjoyable anecdotes from his experience working with the speaker. Lastly &quot;How is the Josh?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one last thing would be the presentation aids prepared by the tech speakers were spellbound. I would appeciate the amount of time, thought and content the speakers have put into the presentations aids / PPT material. I could not differentiate if its online editor or powerpoint tools or excalidraw or just 10x creative powers of the speakers who were frontend engineers.</p>

Treat the below article as an education material only.</p>
<p>On Amazon marketplace, the delivery charges or logistics charges are unavoidable because the amazon products are to be delivered to the customer by Amazon itself.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="amazon-charges-for-the-delivery-directly-and-indirectly">Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly<a href="#amazon-charges-for-the-delivery-directly-and-indirectly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly" title="Direct link to Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Amazon marketplace makes money from both sides.</p>
<ol>
<li>Money from Customers who buy on Amazon</li>
<li>Money from Sellers who sell on Amazon</li>
</ol>
<p>This is when things turn awry for me. As a seller I pay delivery charges based on multiple factors like location of the seller and how far the location is relative to the seller location. As a seller I have no visibility on if the customer is a prime member or not. Neither any discounts on prime are shown to me. As a seller, I have to factor in the delivery charges in the MRP or collect separate delivery fees. As a amazon prime member if I buy the product, I am already paying for the delivery charge which is factored into the pricing by the seller.</p>
<p>If a non amazon prime member does the purchase below the threshold, then the amazon customer has to pay delivery charges twice because the seller has already factored in, the delivery charges along with the cost price and profit.</p>
<p>But Amazon prime members are not really given any &quot;Free Delivery&quot; as promised, its just a waive off of an platform charge associated with Amazon. The 1499 per year is not a discount voucher for delivery charges. In fact, you might have noticed that some products are less than 50 INR in physical stores like pens but on Amazon they are 150Rs etc because of the delivery charges.</p>
<p>Overall the delivery charges are unavoidable on any ecommerce platform and diminishes the value of the sales if the shopper is not careful. To be careful, the shopper need to be aware of the prices in the real world.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Both Amazon Prime and Non Prime members bear the shipping charges directly and indirectly</li>
<li>As a online shopper, think of the value of the shopping transaction before you close the purchase along with myriad other quality and other concerns.</li>

<p>In the army, the personnel are called soldiers. In tech companies, the personnel are called resources. The army trains in camps and carries weapons. Resources work in offices, GCC, and carry laptops. In 2020 due to covid pandemic outbreak, the resources were asked to work from home. Thats how the resources experienced work from home lifestyle, the episode started. Fast forward 2024, the resources are asked to leave behind the work from home and come back to office marking the end of episode work from home, lovingly called the WFH.</p>
<p>Some companies went the extra mile and allowed the resources to work from anywhere forever. In a similar time frame, I wrote an article about <a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working#what-is-the-difference-between-wfh-and-remote-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work from home vs remote working</a>. The key takeaway was that working from home was a temporary fix unless the company adopted the culture mentioned in the book <a href="https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-remote-office-not-required/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote, Office Not Required</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of 2024, almost all companies have given a first call, second call, or in some cases, a final call asking resources to get back to working from the office. This means that the comfort of working from home and the associated lifestyle is no more. But there have to be a few reasons why the back-to-office movement is happening. Of course, there are many reasons; here are a few as quoted by management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office">Reasons to get back to the office<a href="#reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office" title="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Covid is out of the picture; we can get back to the old way of working from the office. Our senior management is already doing it.</li>
<li>Operating in silos or as small teams won&#x27;t boost the morale of the team or the culture of the company.</li>
<li>Use the office as a space to build your personal brand.</li>
<li>Please come to the office and use the building; we have purchased or leased it already for the long term. We have made it better in the recent renovation.</li>
<li>The economy depends on your return to the office; the cab drivers, janitors, and realtors need you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you ask me, except for the first reason, the others should not be taken seriously.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="how-management-is-pulling-resources-back-to-the-office">How management is pulling resources back to the office<a href="#how-management-is-pulling-resources-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How management is pulling resources back to the office" title="Direct link to How management is pulling resources back to the office" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The company-wide call announcing mandatory work from the office for a minimum of 3 days.</li>
<li>Check if employees have punched into the office for a minimum of 3 days or 50% of working days.</li>
<li>Bring in a policy that allows reduced pay for people working remotely.</li>
<li>Bring in another policy that values presence in the office. No promotion if not working from the office. Personally, this statement is dangerous. Companies pay higher salaries to retain employees and not out of obligation. Having said that, more salary reduction could mean being on the layoff list.</li>
<li>In-office meetings and not having the option for online participation from WFH resources.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="my-reaction-to-the-back-to-office-episode">My reaction to the back-to-office episode<a href="#my-reaction-to-the-back-to-office-episode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My reaction to the back-to-office episode" title="Direct link to My reaction to the back-to-office episode" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>In late 2020, after analyzing the implementation of WFH, it was clear that this was a temporary arrangement.</li>
<li>I condemn the press statements and town hall speeches by the management of tech companies in favor of working from anywhere. Everyone believed that working from home would continue forever.</li>
<li>Later in 2023, the management was the first to step into the office, followed by their immediate teams. This set an example for the whole company that working from the office is the way to conduct business.</li>
<li>Working from the office could mean perks like team lunches and client visits happening soon. Good for those with passports ready.</li>
<li>Companies need to be mindful about the transition and set the deadlines accordingly. Some employees were working in their pyjamas for long hours at home. In the work-from-office arrangement, they will waste time commuting, etc.</li>
<li>I am surprised when no management person said that working from the office is an opportunity for osmosis of ideas, easy to mentor juniors, or have fun moments. It looks like none of these happen at the workplace anymore or have been forgotten because of insufficient use.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="dont-go-to-extremes">Don&#x27;t go to extremes<a href="#dont-go-to-extremes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Don&#x27;t go to extremes" title="Direct link to Don&#x27;t go to extremes" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>One person got into an argument where he refused to take the laptop home in the work-from-office arrangement, which led to tensions at the workplace. Accept that no system is perfect and software has bugs. In a long career span of 40 years, anything can happen. Many trends come and go.</p>
<p>We lived the WFH moment; it&#x27;s time to move on.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/workplace">workplace</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/2024/discussing-UI-director-job-role-capgemini">Exploring the Capgemini UI Director Role, A Deep Dive</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-02-05T13:30:30.000Z">February 5, 2024</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown">

<p>In the vast landscape of job opportunities in the Indian subcontinent, the niche role of design technologists remains as elusive as the majestic tigers that roam the region. Job postings for design technologists are a rarity, and it&#x27;s not every day that one comes across such an opportunity. Recently, I stumbled upon a job posting from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3812056674/?alternateChannel=search&amp;refId=Dz%2BIExfUI9357n%2BKI2VWsA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=lY7zJQJjL%2Bd6EeIWSGrk8Q%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Bangalore for the position of Design Technologist</a>. As a lead design technologist, I feel compelled to delve into the contours of this intriguing job opportunity.</p>

<p>The role of a design technologist lacks a universally accepted definition in the job market, prompting the Amazon recruiter to articulate their interpretation. As a Design Technologist at Amazon, one is expected to strike a balance between technical execution and design strategy, contributing to the creation of innovative landing pages and digital ad solutions. The ideal candidate possesses a passion for both design and development, demonstrating strong front-end proficiency, creative problem-solving skills, and a discerning eye for world-class functional design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Design and Technical Leadership = Design Technologist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core attributes of a design technologist encompass conveying design strategy through code, proficiency in front-end technologies, UX patterns, and best practices, building prototypes with vanilla JS and CSS, attention to detail in library maintenance, and the ability to work on multiple projects while creatively solving business challenges.</p>

<p>The Amazon recruiter has outlined several unique requirements for the design technologist role:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development experience across multiple devices, web-views, and browsers.</li>
<li>Delivery of functional prototypes on new devices.</li>

<p>The job requirements clearly emphasize mastery in frontend development, design, and UI with a focus on animations. An ideal candidate may have undergone a career transition from UX to Frontend or vice versa at some point. This role may not align with the skill set of full-stack engineers.</p>
<p>Rigorous preparation is paramount for applicants aiming to stand out in a competitive landscape. The scarcity of job openings necessitates a 10x effort in interview preparation, with priority often given to candidates from top colleges, those with resumes from reputed companies, and those with referrals. Design technologist roles demand intensive preparation, as exemplified by the specifics outlined in the discussed Amazon job posting.</p>
