<p>As a techie, managing digital spending has come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to managing finances and subscriptions. One recurring issue that has cost me money on multiple occasions is the use of standing instructions for payments, where entering credit card details during free trials can lead to unforeseen financial consequences. In this blog post, I will share three instances where standing instructions resulted in financial loss and discuss strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="google-cloud-the-silent-bill-accumulator">Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator<a href="#google-cloud-the-silent-bill-accumulator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator" title="Direct link to Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Same can happen on any cloud services aggregator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud&#x27;s free tier is a playground for developers, offering a range of services to experiment with. However, the requirement to enter credit card information exposes users to potential financial risks. Some dormant services can accumulate bills, and unpaid amounts accrue interest at a hefty 30% per annum. To avoid an unpleasant surprise, it is crucial for developers to actively monitor their Google Cloud billing section, even when services are in a dormant stage. While setting budgets can help control costs, it&#x27;s imperative to note that alerts alone may not prevent services from running over the set limit.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="netflix-and-allies-the-subscription-renewal-trap">Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap<a href="#netflix-and-allies-the-subscription-renewal-trap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap" title="Direct link to Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Managing media consumption subscriptions can be challenging, especially when juggling multiple platforms. To optimize costs, my family cycles through apps every two months to watch all available titles without paying for them simultaneously. The challenge lies in remembering to cancel subscriptions before they auto-renew. Forgetting to do so results in wasted money. Vigilance and regular subscription audits are essential to avoid unnecessary charges.</p>

<p>Yearly renewing subscriptions often come with an unwelcome surpriseâ€”the increased subscription price. Unfortunately, standing instructions automatically accept the higher cost, even if the renewed service may no longer be worth the investment. To prevent this, it&#x27;s crucial to reassess the value of the service before allowing standing instructions to renew it automatically.</p>

<li>
<p>Maintain a Detailed Record: Create and regularly update an Excel sheet containing all websites where you&#x27;ve authorized standing instructions for payments. This centralized record will serve as a quick reference and aid in monitoring financial commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay Informed: Actively monitor notifications and emails related to payments and billing. Ignoring these alerts can lead to unintended financial consequences. Stay informed to take timely action. In India we have sihub website where we can see all the autopay instructions in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek Remedies: In case of discrepancies or unexpected charges, don&#x27;t hesitate to seek help from customer support. Engage with the respective platforms to find a suitable remedy, which might include closing an account or modifying standing instructions.</p>

<p>As a techie, navigating the world of standing instructions requires diligence and strategic planning. By learning from my experiences with Google Cloud, media subscriptions, and renewal surprises, you can implement proactive strategies to avoid financial losses. Maintain meticulous records, stay informed, and don&#x27;t hesitate to seek help when needed.

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technical blogs, where discussions often revolve around technology trends, career advice, and personal life hacks, there emerges a new wave of content â€“ one rooted in societal impact. Enter DSR, or Developer Social Responsibility, a concept akin to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) undertaken by companies.</p>
<p>Traditionally, major corporations like Tata Consultancy Services (TCSL) allocate a portion of their resources towards community-centric initiatives through CSR. In a similar vein, I, as a developer, am embarking on a novel journey â€“ utilizing my platform to craft posts that serve the local community or residents of my locality. The underlying ethos of DSR is to provide valuable information that may not be readily available in the public domain, thereby bridging knowledge gaps and fostering a sense of community support.</p>
<p>Understanding the Principles of DSR Posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Conciseness is Key:</strong>
DSR posts will embody brevity without compromising on substance. By distilling information into concise and digestible content, the aim is to deliver maximum value in a minimal timeframe. This ensures that readers can easily assimilate the information and apply it to their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Tone:</strong>
DSR posts will steer clear of a complaining or negative tone. The objective is to inspire and uplift, offering solutions and insights that empower readers rather than dwelling on issues. This positive approach not only resonates better with the audience but also aligns with the constructive spirit of social responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Social Media Promotion:</strong>
Unlike conventional blog posts that often rely heavily on social media channels for promotion, DSR posts will take a different route. By abstaining from aggressive promotion on platforms, the focus remains on organic reach and genuine engagement. This approach ensures that the content reaches those genuinely interested in community-centric information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In adopting the DSR framework, the intention is clear: to create content that transcends the digital realm and makes a tangible impact on the lives of individuals within the community. This initiative seeks to foster a sense of responsibility among developers, urging them to leverage their skills and knowledge for the betterment of society.</p>
<p>As the DSR journey unfolds, the commitment to concise, positive, and community-centric content remains steadfast. By embracing this unique approach, developers can play an active role in shaping a more informed, empowered, and connected society, one blog post at a time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/blogging">blogging</a></li><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/dsr-post">DSR-post</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/2024/10-things-principal-frontend-job-boards-W1">Insights from Senior Frontend Engineers Job Descriptions - Week 1, 2024</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-01-03T13:30:30.000Z">January 3, 2024</time> Â· <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown">

<p>In a world inundated with financial advice, it&#x27;s surprising that many young professionals, especially the techies, still find themselves struggling financially. As someone who has risen from financial difficulties, I feel compelled to share my insights in what might be my last blog post on personal finance. This one&#x27;s dedicated to my fellow bachelor employee countrymen who are navigating the complexities of finances without a strategy. Remember you need money from even before you are born and after you are dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: This article is my last blog article about financial planning for bachelor techies in India.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the Types:</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve observed that bachelor techies can be broadly classified into two types:</p>
<p><strong>Type 1:</strong> No Debt</p>
<p><strong>Type 2:</strong> Have Debt</p>
<p>Let us assume your salary is 100 INR in your bank account, how to allocate salary of 100 INR? Now, let&#x27;s delve into the nitty-gritty of an ideal financial plan based on your type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on your salary, you may adjust the percentage split but ensure you have plan to send money into each category.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="type-1-no-debt">Type 1: No Debt<a href="#type-1-no-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type 1: No Debt" title="Direct link to Type 1: No Debt" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>For those fortunate enough to have no outstanding commitments, allocating your salary wisely is relatively simple:</p>
<p>First Batch - Investment</p>
<ol>
<li>15Rs: Retirement Savings</li>
<li>15Rs: Stocks/Business</li>
<li>15Rs: Short-Term Savings</li>
</ol>
<p>Second Batch - Expenses</p>
<ol>
<li>20Rs: Rent/HRA</li>
<li>20Rs: General Expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>Third Batch - Others</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Discretionary</li>
<li>5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="type-2-have-debt">Type 2: Have Debt<a href="#type-2-have-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type 2: Have Debt" title="Direct link to Type 2: Have Debt" translate="no">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>If you find yourself burdened with loans, a strategic approach is necessary:</p>
<p>Priority Batch - Debt Servicing</p>
<ol>
<li>25Rs: EMI</li>
<li>10Rs: Principal Repayment</li>
</ol>
<p>First Batch - Investment</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Retirement Savings</li>
<li>5Rs: Stocks/Business</li>
<li>10Rs: Short-Term Savings</li>
</ol>
<p>Second Batch - Expenses</p>
<ol>
<li>20Rs: Rent/HRA</li>
<li>20Rs: General Expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>Third Batch - Others</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses</li>
</ol>

<p>Two critical points emerge from these allocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survival Mode: Until your loans are fully serviced, you&#x27;re essentially in survival mode. This phase might be tough, but it&#x27;s essential to secure a healthy financial future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future Planning: Without a strategic approach, you might compromise your financial stability in the long run.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from allocating your salary smartly, consider these practical tips to bolster your financial health:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Debt Refinancing: Explore options to reduce interest rates on existing loans. If possible, avoid debt leverage to raise wealth or buy consumables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lean Lifestyle: Embrace a frugal lifestyle and look for value buys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Support: Seek assistance from family to share the financial burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expense Prevention: Avoid unnecessary expenses that can lead to a chain of additional financial burdens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health and Safety: Maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent unexpected medical expenses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Everyone aspires to retire peacefully with financial security. Being in survival mode, you cannot retire even in your old age. In a world where loans and notices clutter newspapers, leading a debt-free life simplifies everything. As bachelor techies, understanding your financial type and making strategic decisions today will pave the way for a secure and stress-free tomorrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newspapers would have less pages if nobody defaulted on their loans. Your life would be simple and stress free without debt.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of YouTube success, many content creators find themselves on a quest for the perfect gadgets to enhance their production quality. I too embarked on this journey, investing in four gadgets with the hope of elevating my content. However, hindsight has brought clarity, revealing that these purchases did not contribute significantly to my YouTube success. In this blog post, I&#x27;ll delve into each gadget and share the lessons learned.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="1-whiteboard-and-marker-pens-simplicity-vs-practicality">1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality<a href="#1-whiteboard-and-marker-pens-simplicity-vs-practicality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality" title="Direct link to 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>At first glance, a whiteboard and marker pens seemed like a practical investment to recreate a classroom setting for content demonstrations. However, I soon realized that this setup required a level of confidence and was better suited for academic content. For my YouTube endeavors, originality, presentation, uniqueness, and searchability took precedence over the traditional classroom approach.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="2-digital-pens-the-unanticipated-learning-curve">2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve<a href="#2-digital-pens-the-unanticipated-learning-curve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve" title="Direct link to 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Digital pens promised seamless scribbling and emphasis during screen sharing. Unfortunately, the reality included a steep learning curve. The basic digital pen I initially purchased turned out to be of little use without acquiring the specific skills needed. This experience underscored the importance of thoroughly researching and understanding the tools before making a purchase.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="3-software-for-editing-a-windows-update-and-more">3.

<p>Video editing is an indispensable aspect of content creation, and I invested time in updating my Windows and learning the nuances of video editing. While I achieved some success, the hardware limitations of my PC hindered the production of high-quality, full-HD videos. This realization highlighted the need for a balance between software proficiency and hardware capabilities to meet the standards of modern YouTube content.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="4-lavalier-microphone-battling-ambient-noise">4.

<p>Capturing pristine audio in a less-than-ideal environment posed a significant challenge. Despite the assistance of a lavalier microphone, the ambient noise from barking dogs and honking drivers persisted, preventing the attainment of studio-quality audio. This experience emphasized the importance of considering the external factors that can impact audio quality and exploring alternative solutions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, achieving YouTube success requires a blend of skills, awareness, and time commitmentâ€”factors that I found myself lacking. While certain gadgets, like a camera stand and a reliable camera phone, proved to be useful, the shift towards shorts and reels emerged as a more practical strategy. Testing content with shorter formats allows creators to gauge audience response without the need for an expensive infrastructure required for full-length videos.</p>
<p>Aspiring YouTubers should prioritize understanding their niche, refining their content, and gradually investing in tools that align with their evolving needs. Rather than hastily diving into full-length videos, a strategic focus on shorts and reels can provide valuable insights and pave the way for a more sustainable path to YouTube success.</p>

<p>In the dynamic world of content creation, platforms like YouTube have played a pivotal role in connecting creators with their audiences. As someone who embarked on a YouTube journey in 2020, I experienced the highs and lows of content creation. However, after three years of dedication, I found myself at a crossroads, leading me to make the tough decision to step away from the platform. In this post, I&#x27;ll delve into the three primary reasons that prompted me to bid farewell to YouTube and explore an alternative path that aligns better with my goals.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="reason-1-landscape-has-changed">Reason 1: Landscape has changed<a href="#reason-1-landscape-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 1: Landscape has changed" title="Direct link to Reason 1: Landscape has changed" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in content creation as people sought new ways to spend their time. The demand for content was high, but by 2023, the landscape had transformed significantly. Educational content creators faced a daunting challenge of standing out amidst the crowd pullers like news, comics, and film-related content. Unfortunately, educational content struggled to capture the audience&#x27;s attention, making it increasingly challenging for solo creators to thrive.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="reason-2-posted-content-does-not-get-promoted">Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted<a href="#reason-2-posted-content-does-not-get-promoted" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted" title="Direct link to Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>While YouTube serves as a vast platform with immense potential, getting content noticed became an uphill battle. The algorithmic changes and sheer volume of content meant that creators had to rely on their existing subscriber base or invest in promotional efforts. For those starting from scratch, breaking through the noise proved to be as challenging as finding a needle in a haystack. The lack of organic promotion made it difficult for new creators without a substantial audience to showcase their work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="reason-3-form-over-content">Reason 3: Form over content<a href="#reason-3-form-over-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 3: Form over content" title="Direct link to Reason 3: Form over content" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The evolution of content creation standards brought forth new challenges. The days when a front camera sufficed for creating engaging content are long gone. Today, success demands high-quality cameras, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds, captivating thumbnail graphics, and more. The time-consuming process of adhering to these visual standards often took away from the core focus â€“ the content itself. This shift towards a more polished presentation, while visually appealing, did not necessarily translate into increased viewership.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="alternative">Alternative<a href="#alternative" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternative" title="Direct link to Alternative" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>In light of these challenges, I&#x27;ve decided to retreat from YouTube content creation and refocus my efforts on traditional blogging. Leveraging the power of AI tools, my blogging endeavors have seen a resurgence. The efficiency and effectiveness of these tools have allowed me to rediscover the joy of content creation without the constraints and challenges posed by the ever-evolving landscape of YouTube.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion:" title="Direct link to Conclusion:" translate="no">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The decision to step away from YouTube was not made lightly, and it&#x27;s essential for content creators to regularly reassess their chosen platforms. While YouTube remains a giant in the industry, the shifting landscape and challenges faced by solo creators necessitate adaptability. For those seeking a more flexible and personally fulfilling creative outlet, exploring alternative mediums, like traditional blogging with AI enhancements, might prove to be the key to sustained success and satisfaction.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_L0Yz padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/content">content</a></li><li class="tag_G85p"><a rel="tag" class="tag_kdqF tagRegular_fNqn" href="/blog/tags/youtube">youtube</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/blog/2023/4-step-process-to-stay-updated">Keeping Updated at Frontend Tech, 4 Strategies Beyond Blogs and Podcasts</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-18T15:30:22.000Z">October 18, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_GsyF"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_c8fO" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_mTBX"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_BBD_" translate="no">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_zTQm" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_LIU_"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/confused-boy-d9d070205429f6f9c3c8af0fdcc04f6a.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_FerL"></p>
