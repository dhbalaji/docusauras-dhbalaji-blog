<p>My journey with computers has been… vivid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Started with an assembled PC which broke in 2 years</li>
<li>Tried a netbook which looked like a toy in hindsight, broke in 2 years</li>
<li>Switched to a refurbished Dell CPU from an unreliable shop which lasted 6 months, abandoned at the repair shop</li>
<li>Bought a Dell Inspiron (used) which surprisingly served 9 years (10 years total age)</li>
<li>Worked with at least 10+ managed devices given by employers</li>
<li>Today<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>running a Dell Precision (11th gen CPU) for coding, content creation and local LLMs</li>
<li>running a Dell Inspiron (4th gen CPU) for browsing and on the move</li>
<li>M1 mac managed by employer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Consumer printers vs business printers. Consumer cars vs taxis. Consumer PCs vs business PCs. The business-grade version always outlives the shiny consumer one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s why business PCs dominate both new and used markets.</p>

<p>Consumer laptops are built for light use, good on a store shelf. Stress them and you’ll see broken hinges, dead keyboards, flimsy motherboards, and underpowered chargers.</p>
<p>Business laptops look boring, but they are engineered for 5–7 years of daily grind. Hinges, chargers, and keyboards are higher grade. Battery management is smarter and avoids overcharging when docked all day.</p>

<p>Business PCs almost always come with higher upfront costs, but TCO—the sum of purchase, support, downtime, and productivity—strongly favors business-grade hardware[3][4][10].</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies estimate the TCO for a well-managed business laptop to range from $4,600 to $9,793 over three years, with most savings coming from reduced downtime and support costs[4].</li>
<li>A device with a 1% failure rate versus 5% can save a company over $330,000 annually per 1,000 laptops, primarily through reduced productivity loss and support expenses[4].</li>
<li>Extended warranty, sled deployment, multi-year OS support, and modular parts drive long-term value.</li>
<li>IT operations costs (OPEX) and user downtime can exceed capital costs for hardware—lowering failures, easier service, and scalable deployment lead to major ROI[1][3][4].</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Match hardware to intended use:</strong> Office tasks, fieldwork, or production workloads need corresponding device durability and support.</li>
<li><strong>Balance upgrade cycles and productivity:</strong> Short cycles add complexity and expense; longer lifecycles (5+ years) minimize disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Consider indirect costs:</strong> Support, downtime, security breaches, compliance, and device failures are more expensive than the purchase price.</li>
<li><strong>Plan for the future:</strong> Invest in modular, repairable hardware with warranty and vendor support. Evaluate AI features, but monitor real-world impact before heavy adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Engage IT and end-users:</strong> Gather feedback from IT on manageability and from users on workflow bottlenecks.</li>

<p>This wasn’t just another club meeting.</p>
<p>It was a <strong>cross-border alliance of wit, wisdom, and wow-moments</strong> — a <strong>joint meeting of Area A5 clubs</strong>, featuring powerhouses from <strong>Vellore, Hosur</strong>, mind blowing education session speakers and beyond.</p>
<p>And right at the tail end of this prestigious gathering, I was handed a mic and a mission: to felicitate, celebrate, and wrap up sessions like a pro — all in <strong>under 45 seconds per role taker</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s what the felicitation ceremony looked like:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 people to be felicitated</li>
<li>3 dignitaries on stage</li>
<li>Me giving light-hearted appreciation</li>
<li>Person comes on stage, collects the gift</li>
<li>Photographer gives a thumbs up after the click</li>
<li>I call the next person</li>
</ul>
<p>Smooth, right? Almost.</p>

<p>The official Toastmasters website had <em>hardly any information</em> on the felicitation role.</p>
<p>Later, in a discussion with my <strong>mentee-turned-DTM</strong>, I learned that this role is the <strong>brainchild of the Conference Chair</strong> — someone who truly believes in the “division of labour”... or should I say, <em>division of roles</em>.</p>
<p>Though the plan was to have two people share the felicitation duties, the universe decided that one person — me — was a perfect (and only) fit.</p>
<p>Special shoutout to <strong>TM Monica, CA</strong>, whose calm, coaching-style leadership helped me manage the logistics and statistics required to perform this role without chaos.</p>

<p>On a Sunday, if I start my bike before 9 AM, it knows exactly where to go — straight to the farmers’ market, where I shop mindfully without worrying about GST.<br>
<!-- -->But today isn’t an ordinary Sunday.<br>
<!-- -->A Toastmasters conference in my sleepy little town, <strong>Hosur</strong>, with members from <strong>District 120 and beyond</strong> converging at <strong>Advaith School</strong> — now <em>that</em> deserves a chapter in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For making this happen, everyone in this room deserves to be felicitated.</p>
<p>The felicitation ceremony had <strong>two parts</strong>:<br>
<strong>Part 1</strong> – Role players<br>
<strong>Part 2</strong> – Honouring the <em>crust above the rest</em></p>

<p>I invited the following dignitaries to the stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Division A Director <strong>TM Pratheepa Sukumar</strong></li>
<li>Area D5 Director <strong>TM Bharat Nandhagopal</strong></li>
<li>Conference Chair <strong>TM Caroline Padankatti</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let the show begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>“From gathering registrations on AllEvents to reminding us to carry water bottles, pens, and sharing every crucial detail — welcome on stage, Registration Chair <strong>TM Samuel</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“The silent force of Hosur Toastmasters, from co-registration to backend updates — welcome, Co-registration Chair <strong>TM Saravanan</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“From informative posters to nostalgic TV-box reels and timely reminders — welcome, PR Chair <strong>TM Vani Ugin</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“From backstage coffee to guest care — you were everywhere! Welcome, Hospitality Chair and mighty president of Hosur TM, <strong>TM Gary Michael Henderson</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Your voice carried confidence and set the morning tempo — Emcee Morning, <strong>TM Abidha Shah</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Professional, composed, and to the point — Timer, <strong>TM Priyadharshini</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Post-lunch slump didn’t stand a chance — Emcee Afternoon, <strong>TM Nandini</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Solid stage presence and seamless coordination — <strong>TM Ramesh</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Every great event runs on time, and every second counts — Timer, <strong>TM Saranya</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“Delivering precise timing reports — Timer, <strong>TM Abinaya Kannan</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>“She set the venue, ran behind mics, and now she’s at center stage handing over gifts — our SAA, <strong>TM Monica</strong>!”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And of course, <strong>TM Balaji</strong> – myself, multitasking through all of this with a grin.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did go off-script occasionally to inject humor — the energy in the room had started dipping post-lunch, and quite a few attendees had already <em>vanished</em> for their afternoon nap.</p>

<p>Next, I invited the <em>District Trio</em> — a term I learned just a week earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>District Director, DTM Parthasarathy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Club Growth Director, DTM Anirudh</strong></li>
<li><strong>Program Quality Director, TM Vinoth Kumar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Also invited, in the same sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Division A Director, TM Pratheepa Sukumar</strong></li>
<li><strong>Area D5 Director, TM Bharat Nandhagopal</strong> – effortlessly cool</li>
<li><strong>TM Caroline Padankatti</strong> – the power behind the stage who stayed composed even during 9 PM Google Meet marathons</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd rate myself <strong>4 out of 5</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I came prepared</li>
<li>I added personal flair</li>
<li>I adjusted in real time</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I would do differently: I should have <strong>orchestrated stage movements better</strong>, such as having the first set of dignitaries return to their seats before inviting the next batch.</p>
<p>Other than that, the show went smoothly.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's the segment where the audience starts <strong>scanning for snacks</strong> (pun intended)</li>
<li>Role takers and dignitaries expect a <strong>professional wrap-up</strong>, not a duct-tape script</li>
<li>You’ll have <strong>last-minute add-ons</strong> whispered to you in front of 50 people while you’re holding a mic and pretending everything’s under control</li>
<li>You must remain <strong>calm, composed, and ready to improvise</strong></li>
<li>Carrying notes isn't optional — it’s a <strong>survival tool</strong></li>
<li>Yes, you do get felicitated in the same ceremony (just don’t expect a standing ovation)</li>

<p>Second time at React Nexus. Bigger venue, bigger sponsors, same old dev jokes. Held at Tata Auditorium, IISC – beautiful place if you like trees and long walks to the nearest metro.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="what-went-down-other-than-my-battery">What Went Down (Other Than My Battery)<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/react-nexus-2025-3-day-summary-in-25-points#what-went-down-other-than-my-battery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Went Down (Other Than My Battery)" title="Direct link to What Went Down (Other Than My Battery)" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logistics</strong>:
One sticker. One tee. One meal per day. That’s the deal. Cab-friendly, metro-unfriendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sponsors</strong>:
Took the stage like Bollywood villains. Some reruns from 2024. Gemini &amp; Copilot aced the quizzes more than the attendees did.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/sponsors-44ad1423ee2098555ff050f07af75a4e.jpg" width="1000" height="750" class="img_FerL"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ImageKit.io</strong>:
Indie builder CEO handing out stickers = 🫶
Who knew images + GenAI + AWS could be a profitable cocktail?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GoDaddy</strong>:
Still selling domains like flash sales. Bought one. Page still says “Hello World.” Now with GenAI, <em>they</em> add the hello page for you. Still pushing Outlook 365 like it’s going out of stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vonage</strong>:
Zoom-ish APIs. Most colorful booth. Least understood by crowd. They were hiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WSO2 Asgardeo</strong>:
Auth-as-a-service. Repeat speaker, repeat stickers. Still no buy-in from bosses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zoho Catalyst</strong>:
“Run everything with us (on free tier).” Indie energy, real. Good for side projects, enterprise signup after sales men raids. Might convert prompt to SaaS if you squint hard enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct Slide</strong>:
The usual “don’t harass women” clause. But honestly, dev conferences now look like HR onboarding. 50/50 gender ratio. Welcome change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>React 19 + NextJS</strong>:
Headliners. React Actions API opened the show. Time to un-dust the docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>:
Peak Bangalore moment: guy hacked, built, and launched a product on New Year’s Eve. 🙌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>React Compiler</strong>:
Still a mystery box. Used in 3D video gen demo—hit and miss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Best Speaker?</strong>
Wadad Parker. Tackled React Context with stand-up energy. Put Toastmasters to shame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GoDaddy Talk on Microfrontends</strong>:
Enlightening. But no tools, just “vibes.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech Company vs Software Company vs Vibe-Coded Startup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech company = builds tech</li>
<li>Software company = builds from packages</li>
<li>Vibe-coded = builds vibes, nothing else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zoho Catalyst (again)</strong>:
Their domain setup is easier than your weekend plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lighthouse Talk (again)</strong>:
Same speaker. Same slides. Different year. Look at <code>web.dev</code> if you need filler content, apparently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Observability</strong>:
Not the same. One alerts, one explains. Both are friends now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frontend QA</strong>:
Smoke tests &gt; Nothing.
Playwright &gt; Hope.
Monitoring &gt; Late-night debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Telemetry 101</strong>:
Metrics, logs, traces... add them to your design system if you want to sound senior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Tools</strong>:
Cursor’s @web, @docs, @diff = DevGPT mode unlocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MCP (Magic Component Platform)</strong>:
Figma → Code without tears.
Everyone's happy. Until you self-host it online and leak your keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>React Dev Joke Moment</strong>:
“Lazy loading is like buying 10 chips, eating one at a time.”
Me: “Bro that’s throttling. Lazy loading = frequent runs to the shop.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>React Native</strong>:
Few talks. Fewer fans. Still exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Browser-LLMs</strong>:
Local LLMs in your browser soon. Because why not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
React is evolving, audiences are engaging, and conferences are quietly becoming better. React Nexus 2025 felt more like a community summit than a sponsor expo—despite the sponsor overload. Chennai devs showed up in droves. Peaceful vibes. Good chai. No one shipped to production from the venue, which is a win.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I still haven’t deployed that domain I bought.</p>

<p>After 14 years in tech — including 7 years at my current company — this isn't a celebration post. It's a reflection.</p>
<p>A career this long doesn’t just give you experience. It gives you patterns. You start noticing what stays, what fades, and what was never real to begin with.</p>
<p>This post isn’t about growth charts, anniversaries, or achievements. It’s a reality check. Especially for those who entered the workforce with dreams shaped by college lectures, parental expectations, or HR onboarding decks.</p>
<p>Bookmark it. Revisit it. Especially when the winds change.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="jobs-are-forever--the-myth-we-bought">Jobs Are Forever — The Myth We Bought<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/7-years-with-one-employer#jobs-are-forever--the-myth-we-bought" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Jobs Are Forever — The Myth We Bought" title="Direct link to Jobs Are Forever — The Myth We Bought" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We were told a job is a destination. Land one, and you’re safe. Study hard, get placed, follow the system, and one day retire in peace. That illusion didn’t survive its first encounter with real-world volatility. For many of us, it collapsed not in our first job, but in the uncertainty of the second or third, where layoffs weren’t just newspaper headlines — they were personal. I vividly remember 2012 — hearing the word <em>layoff</em> not in a company-wide announcement, but in hushed conversations. Someone had run a SQL script to revoke access for 2,000 employees. That one line of code unraveled years of effort in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Like Abhimanyu in the Mahabharata’s chakra vyuha — we were trained to enter the maze, but never taught how to exit with dignity or direction.</p>

<p>Every new tool promises salvation. There's always a 10-hour video, a certification badge, or a learning week calendar invite. But knowledge ≠ transformation. You can’t train your way out of stagnation if you never practice. I’ve seen folks with "12 years of experience" who’ve actually repeated the same year twelve times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, younger teammates with fewer years and sharper instincts bulldoze ahead because they build, break, and ship things. That edge doesn’t come from upskilling videos — it comes from showing up, making calls, failing fast, and bouncing back faster.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="hold-virtual-ownership--but-dont-drown-in-it">Hold Virtual Ownership — But Don’t Drown in It<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/7-years-with-one-employer#hold-virtual-ownership--but-dont-drown-in-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hold Virtual Ownership — But Don’t Drown in It" title="Direct link to Hold Virtual Ownership — But Don’t Drown in It" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>"Take ownership" is on every job description and manager’s checklist. But what does it actually mean in a workplace where ownership is distributed so thinly that no one has true decision power? We all know how “too many cooks” ends. At some point, everyone owns everything and yet nothing gets done. Developer productivity becomes a metric sport, while the product itself has no paying users. Market validation? Not my department. We just sprint. It feels like a rush-hour metro ride — packed, sweaty, and no one is willing to adjust for the person next to them. Everyone's pushing, no one knows where the train is heading.</p>
<p>Virtual ownership without real influence breeds burnout. Masked as initiative, rewarded with more tasks. And if your work isn’t directly influencing product adoption or revenue?  <strong>Better believe someone’s already rewriting your goodbye message.</strong></p>

<p>Whether you’re a fresher or a VP, you are a number in a dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>CGPA</li>
<li>Leetcode percentile</li>
<li>Story points delivered</li>
<li>Uptime maintained</li>
<li>Revenue influenced</li>
<li>Cost avoided</li>
</ul>
<p>If your work can’t be quantified, it’s sidelined. Worse — you start internalizing the idea that you’re not contributing enough, even if you’re the glue holding teams together. I learned this late: Emotional intelligence, long-term thinking, culture-building — these don’t show up in slides. But the system demands that even these be justified with metrics. If not, you risk being seen as "nice to have" when it's time to downsize.</p>

<p>Layoffs are no longer the stuff of boardroom whispers. They're livestream events. Scripted, staged, and delivered over Zoom.</p>
<p>From Big Tech to startups, workforce cuts are no longer a reaction — they're a strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not personal.</li>
<li>It’s not fair.</li>
<li>It’s just business.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing this post, TCS a prestigious Indian company where several employees stayed loyal to Tata Group where put on the line called "first ever 2% workforce reduction". Illustrating the fact, no company is layoff proof. You are only as secure as the revenue forecast or funding runway. You could be the highest performer and still be asked to go because your role didn’t “align with priorities.”</p>

<p>AI is the most discussed guest in the room — invited to every conversation, understood by very few.</p>
<p>In meetings, “Let’s bring in AI” is thrown around like a magical fix. But when asked what exactly it should do, silence follows. Truth is, <strong>AI is today what cloud was in 2012</strong> — full of promise, stuck in pitch decks. By 2030, AI will face its own audit. The novelty will wear off. Leaders will stop using it for press releases and start using it for results. And developers will stop fearing AI — not because it’s weak, but because they'll finally understand what it can and can't do.</p>

<p>It’s easy to preach balance when you’re a spiritual leader with a lake-view campus and loyal donors. But when you’re an employee living month-to-month, <strong>“balance” sounds like a luxury.</strong> When townhall invites trigger dread. When one reorg wipes out months of planning. When even good work ends with a “however” in the appraisal form. No wellness app will fix the anxiety of seeing colleagues disappear from Slack and payroll overnight.</p>
<p>Today, every employee has at least two AI tools watching their work, recording patterns, nudging suggestions — <strong>training to replace them</strong> more than to support them. It’s no longer fiction to imagine a future where brain-implanted AI boosts “efficiency.” Because hey, it’s more important to track keyboard strokes than to turn off the energy-guzzling TVs still looping yesterday’s metrics in an empty office bay.</p>

<p>Work is no longer a straight line. It’s a loop.<br>
<strong>Learn → Build → Make money → Exit → Repeat</strong></p>
<p>14 years in tech. 7 years in one company. This milestone isn’t a victory lap. It’s a checkpoint. A reminder to stay <strong>adaptable</strong>, <strong>humble</strong>, and <strong>detached</strong>. Because in this industry, one truth reigns above all:</p>
<p><strong>Impermanence isn’t a bug — it’s the default setting.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A nerd-dad’s ongoing quest to baby-proof not just the furniture—but the family’s Wi-Fi and screens. NextDNS, mesh routers, and the practical realities of keeping YouTube out of reach without a SaaS subscription nightmare.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/new-tp-link-router-ad8c3f7d9dd46505c863d7daea414242.png" width="994" height="548" class="img_FerL"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="quick-recap">Quick Recap<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2#quick-recap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Quick Recap" title="Direct link to Quick Recap" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We took our first swing at digital hygiene: <strong>NextDNS configured on a non-ISP router, mobile Private DNS set, the whole house subtly steering away from distractions.</strong> Our battle star? The never-ending chase to block YouTube.com for good.</p>
<p>But as always, the story gets more interesting.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-parental-control-problem--isp-routers-just-dont-cut-it">The Parental Control Problem — ISP Routers Just Don’t Cut It<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2#the-parental-control-problem--isp-routers-just-dont-cut-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Parental Control Problem — ISP Routers Just Don’t Cut It" title="Direct link to The Parental Control Problem — ISP Routers Just Don’t Cut It" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The so-called “parental controls” on most ISP-supplied hardware are a masquerade. The DNS fields are locked down; your hands are tied. For real filtering, the only way out is to move to your own hardware so I picked up a <strong>TP-Link mesh router</strong> supporting true mesh networking.</p>
<p>Mesh brings coverage, flexibility, and—crucially—three distinct SSIDs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guest</strong></li>
<li><strong>Smart Devices</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with <strong>NextDNS</strong> set at the router level, everything in the house bows to centralized rules.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="nextdns-profiles-access-levels-like-iam-for-humans">NextDNS Profiles: Access Levels Like IAM for Humans<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2#nextdns-profiles-access-levels-like-iam-for-humans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NextDNS Profiles: Access Levels Like IAM for Humans" title="Direct link to NextDNS Profiles: Access Levels Like IAM for Humans" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>One genius detail about NextDNS is its profile-based filtering, think of it like authorization groups in IAM. Here’s how my rules stack up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> YouTube is blocked everywhere, the good citizens’ network.</li>
<li><strong>Elders:</strong> YouTube allowed (but only when the baby’s not around).</li>
<li><strong>Dev Mode:</strong> Everything permitted—for me, when it’s time to break things or fix them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Side effect:</em> some analytics break, and anyone with the Tor app can waltz past the controls. It’s not bulletproof, but it’s pretty resilient.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="saas-fatigue-and-the-diy-fix">SaaS Fatigue and the DIY Fix<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2#saas-fatigue-and-the-diy-fix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SaaS Fatigue and the DIY Fix" title="Direct link to SaaS Fatigue and the DIY Fix" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Here’s the catch: <strong>NextDNS’s free plan caps at 30,000 DNS requests/month</strong>. That’s enough for one or two users, but add a full house and you’ll hit the wall. The fear: getting locked into yet another SaaS subscription for every single filter.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Temporary solution:</em> Careful rationing, multiple profiles, and possibly automating some extra DNS protection. Still, I have DIY plans brewing to avoid lifelong lock-in.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-result-under-control-for-now">The Result: Under Control… For Now<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/new-dad-network-safety-part-2#the-result-under-control-for-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Result: Under Control… For Now" title="Direct link to The Result: Under Control… For Now" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>With distinct SSIDs, granular DNS filtering, and profile-based controls, the home network feels far more intentional and secure. The only wildcard? Human factors, will elders and guests play along or look for loopholes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I personally save nearly 2 hours a day with no youtube, thats 30 days saved per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But for now, digital discipline is stronger than ever. Parenthood is chaos; your network doesn’t have to be.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>To fellow parents: tweaking your network takes patience, but the peace of mind is worth it. On to the next frontier…</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[After eight years, my trusted Dell Inspiron met an untimely demise during the monsoon. This is the emotional journey of loss, recovery, and the search for a refurbished warrior to rebuild my creative momentum.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/dell-7620-desk-027e93728fc19d9f27c2585cdd32deb4.jpg" width="750" height="1000" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>It began as most heartbreaks do, not with a warning, but with a moment. Eight years of companionship, memories etched into plastic keys and flickering screens. This was not just a laptop; it was a cherished confidant, a silent witness to late-night hustles, travels, and the fragile trust between creator and machine.</p>
<p>But even strong bonds can snap. On a monsoon-drenched evening, fate delivered a blow. The Dell service center greeted me somberly, where a sticker cheerily warned about “monsoon laptop care”—advice, in my case, a little too late. The diagnosis: my beloved Dell Inspiron, dead on arrival. There were no heroic rescues, just a silent mourning and the slow ache that follows a familiar loss.</p>
<p>The fallout was immediate. Backlogs grew like weeds. Blogs languished in drafts as an interim Dell Vostro—salvaged from the garage and coaxed to life with Debian—struggled beneath the weight of creative ambition. The void left by the Inspiron haunted every click. Sooner or later, I knew: it was time to let go and move on.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-pursuit-of-power-and-value">The Pursuit of Power And Value<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/my-monsoon-laptop-saga#the-pursuit-of-power-and-value" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Pursuit of Power And Value" title="Direct link to The Pursuit of Power And Value" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I dreamt, briefly, of a desktop—a machine built on ChatGPT-powered advice, futuristic and mighty. But reality grinned: a 3–5 lakh rupee price tag. It felt absurd, the cost outweighing the gains, with the grey cloud of warranty uncertainty looming. Dell’s tower PCs were impossible to “add to cart” without wading through conversations with bots; the tempting A51 desktop was a crush at first sight, quickly doomed by its price—well above ₹5 lakhs.</p>
<p>The configurations under Dell’s “Workstation” banner cost more than a new Ather Pro scooter. Disheartened, I wandered into the wilds of OLX, mentorless but hopeful.</p>
<p>On OLX, the market teemed with budget laptops—plentiful at 25k, but the beasts I needed lurked rarely, cloaked behind search filters: “Dell i7”, “50k and above”. And yet, despite Apple’s siren song and options aplenty, my heart stayed loyal to Dell—perhaps from habit, perhaps nostalgia.</p>
<p>On OLX, two sellers emerged: individuals hoping for a fair price, and seasoned shopkeepers flipping out-of-warranty stock. Caution prevailed; I chose the latter. Stranger meets in unknown places—money flashing on UPI—felt like a recipe for disaster. I wanted reliability, not adventure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-resurrection-enter-dell-7620">The Resurrection: Enter Dell 7620<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/my-monsoon-laptop-saga#the-resurrection-enter-dell-7620" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Resurrection: Enter Dell 7620" title="Direct link to The Resurrection: Enter Dell 7620" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rgcomputers.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RG Computer, Belandur</a> was unassuming—a small shop, a friendly shopkeeper, and an attentive assistant. There, among reclaimed silicon, sat my contender: the Dell 7560. (Specs to come.) The inspection ritual began:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked the Dell service tag, verified the model’s lineage.</li>
<li>Scanned for scars—deep or faint—from previous lives.</li>
<li>BIOS revealed battery health and year of manufacture (both scrutinized).</li>
<li>Booted and rebooted, measuring patience.</li>
<li>Ran HW Info, checked SSD specs—ensuring no deceit hid beneath the surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shopkeeper walked me through their refurbishing process—old NVMe swapped for a fresh NVMe, a subtle upsell attempt gracefully declined. After two hours, I still forgot to check every key, but luck favored me; all were functional.</p>
<p>Armed with a bill and three months of shop-backed warranty, I walked out—lighter in heart, heavier in hand. The workstation is, in a word, solid. I do not recommend carrying it around on your back, its indeed heavy. I use my Dell Vostro for light work on the move.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="meet-the-beast-dell-7620">Meet the Beast: Dell 7620<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/my-monsoon-laptop-saga#meet-the-beast-dell-7620" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet the Beast: Dell 7620" title="Direct link to Meet the Beast: Dell 7620" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel i7, 11th Gen, 8 cores @2.50GHz</li>
<li>32GB DDR4 RAM</li>
<li>512GB healthy NVMe storage</li>
<li>Nvidia 6GB graphics</li>
<li>Windows 11 Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I Don’t Understand Yet</p>
<ul>
<li>The 180W charger—why such a power-hungry beast for this machine?</li>
<li>The air vents, reminiscent of a car radiator, puzzling me with their design and purpose.</li>
<li>The CPU core temperatures, often hovering at 50°C and above—stable or stealth warning?</li>
</ul>
<p>Red Flags? Of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of Dell warranty, over four years old</li>
<li>Noticeable signs of prior use</li>
<li>Fingerprint sensor, more gimmick than guardian</li>
</ul>
<p>But for ₹55k? In my urgency, the deal felt fair. Back at the desk, it stood firm—two USB-Cs, two USBs, HDMI, and a DP port. It powers two monitors, a cooling pad, and more. The webcam is decent (bonus: a privacy slider).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="epilogue-grief-growth-gratitude">Epilogue: Grief, Growth, Gratitude<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/my-monsoon-laptop-saga#epilogue-grief-growth-gratitude" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Epilogue: Grief, Growth, Gratitude" title="Direct link to Epilogue: Grief, Growth, Gratitude" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Three weeks in, I’m surprised by the stability. I’m building again—products, content, momentum. The wound from the monsoon disaster remains, but it’s fading, replaced by a story of resilience and renewal.</p>
<p><strong>Overall rating: 4.5/5.</strong> For a refurbished warrior and a rekindled creator’s journey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Expecting a baby? You’ve probably baby-proofed your furniture, but what about your Wi-Fi and devices? In today’s world, computer networks are as important as cribs and car seats. Here’s how I—a nerdy new dad—secured my digital den for my family’s safety and sanity.</p>

<p>Most homes today have more than one way to get online, even if you don’t realize it. <strong>Computer networks</strong> are everywhere—broadband, mobile data, and hotspots.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="count-the-networks">Count the Networks<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/preparing-home-network-before-first-child#count-the-networks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Count the Networks" title="Direct link to Count the Networks" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Total Networks at home =</strong> 1 broadband + each phone with an active mobile data plan</p>
<p>That means your child’s screen time could sneak in through any of these entry points. First step: identify and isolate them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Internet → ISP Router (Wi-Fi &amp; LAN) → All Devices → your child</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the ISP’s router full control over DNS, firewall rules, and device access. Not ideal for a security-conscious parent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smart phones + data packs → your child</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data packs by carrier don’t give any parental control tools.</p>
<p>We need to target the network-level filtering, which is generally good enough to block ads, parked domains, and time wasters.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Break your writer’s slump with this cheeky take on the classic struggles within tech teams – from the senior-junior conundrum and cost-cutting debates to the never-ending outsourcing squeeze. If you’ve been in tech for even a minute, you’ll relate.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you just need to break the writer’s slump, and what better way than to air some tech community laundry/gossips. Here are <strong>3 classic struggles</strong> that keep popping up, no matter how fast the AI world moves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/senior-junior-51f87aea32a9ab85308c84886b9621b6.webp" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_FerL"></p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect"><strong>1. Senior vs. Junior Conundrum – The Banyan Tree Effect</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/common-it-industry-triffles#1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect" title="Direct link to 1-senior-vs-junior-conundrum--the-banyan-tree-effect" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Juniors often feel like they’re <strong>growing in the shadow</strong> of their seniors – those <strong>strong, wide-spread banyan trees</strong> that <strong>block opportunities</strong> and stunt their growth. This isn’t just a theory – data shows that <strong>nearly 30% of techies</strong> with <strong>less than 3 years of experience</strong> switch jobs, looking for <strong>more sunlight and fresh air</strong>.</p>
<p>For juniors, the challenge isn’t just the learning curve but <strong>finding their voice</strong> in a team where the seniors have already taken the best seats. It’s like trying to grow a startup in a market dominated by FAANG.</p>
<p>While seniors are busy debating the <strong>best design pattern for a microservice</strong>, juniors are trying to get their <strong>first pull request merged</strong> without being roasted on the code review thread. It’s a constant game of <strong>"How many comments will this PR get before it’s finally approved?"</strong>, <strong>"Will anyone mentor me honestly about all corners of the long career ahead?"</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Seniors, on the other hand, see juniors as a <strong>potential threat</strong> – the fresh minds who come in armed with <strong>JavaScript, Python, and React</strong> and casually throw around terms like <strong>LLMs</strong>, <strong>prompt engineering</strong>, <strong>hackathons</strong> and <strong>vector databases</strong>. Meanwhile, the seniors are still perfecting the art of <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>JPA</strong>, occasionally grumbling about how <strong>Java 8</strong> was the last “real” upgrade.</p>
<p>It’s not just about skills – it’s about <strong>mindset</strong>. The seniors have survived <strong>production outages at 3 AM</strong>, managed <strong>political office battles</strong>, and <strong>honestly mentored</strong> a generation of developers who now run startups.</p>
<p>Juniors, on the other hand, are still fresh, living out of <strong>PG rooms</strong>, debugging their code on <strong>15-inch laptops</strong>, and pushing code on a <strong>5G hotspot</strong> while dodging their roommate’s PUBG screams. They may lack experience, but they have the raw <strong>hustle, curiosity, and caffeine tolerance</strong> that seniors often lose along the way.</p>
<p>And if you want a real generational gap, just bring up <strong>Agile vs. Waterfall</strong> in a meeting. The seniors will reminisce about the days when <strong>project plans were thicker than the SRS document</strong>, while the juniors wonder if they should include <strong>Agile Scrum</strong> in their LinkedIn profile.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown"><strong>2. Employee vs. Management – The Cost-Cutting Showdown</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/common-it-industry-triffles#2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown" title="Direct link to 2-employee-vs-management--the-cost-cutting-showdown" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to cutting costs, <strong>management</strong> often takes the path of least resistance – <strong>reduce headcount</strong>. Performance, age, location, experience – all fair game when trimming the payroll. This is the <strong>"high-impact, low-cost"</strong> strategy that features in every MBA case study.</p>
<p>From the management perspective, it’s all about <strong>"optimizing the org chart"</strong> and <strong>"maximizing shareholder value"</strong> – fancy phrases that essentially mean <strong>fewer people, more profit</strong>. The logic is simple: cutting the bottom 10% might save the company <strong>millions</strong> without the <strong>PR disaster</strong> of reducing executive perks.</p>
<p>But employees see it differently. To them, the real savings lie in <strong>cutting the fat at the top</strong>. After all, the <strong>CEO earning 100x</strong> the average developer’s salary, <strong>VPs</strong> flying business class, and middle managers enjoying plush perks attending meetings.</p>
<p>And then there’s the <strong>perks debate</strong>. Employees argue that cutting <strong>free food, and fancy offices</strong> in favor of <strong>WFH (Work From Home)</strong> could save millions. After all, those ping-pong tables and <strong>bean bags</strong> aren’t exactly mission-critical. And let’s be real – the only people who truly use the office gym are the same ones who have the time for <strong>marathon LinkedIn posts</strong>.</p>
<p>This is especially stark in India, where <strong>C-level executives</strong> at top tech firms earn <strong>crores per annum</strong>, while a fresh developer might make <strong>7-15 LPA</strong>. The disparity is not just in the paychecks but also in the <strong>power to decide the fate of others</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities"><strong>3. The Outsourcing Squeeze – A Tale of Two Realities</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/common-it-industry-triffles#3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities" title="Direct link to 3-the-outsourcing-squeeze--a-tale-of-two-realities" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Outsourcing is a simple idea – move work to a cheaper location and <strong>save big</strong>. India, with its massive pool of <strong>highly skilled engineers</strong>, is a top destination for this. In 2024 alone, India’s <strong>IT exports</strong> were estimated at over <strong>$250 billion</strong>, with <strong>GCCs (Global Capability Centers)</strong> in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai leading the charge.</p>
<p>But this efficiency comes with a human cost. For every American worker laid off, there’s likely a replacement in Bangalore, Manila, or Chengdu doing the same work at a fraction of the cost. It’s the <strong>"rob Peter to pay Paul"</strong> strategy of the corporate world.</p>
<p>But it’s not a bed of roses for the outsourcers either. They’re often stuck in <strong>corporate jungles</strong> – the GCCs of India – doing the same work for <strong>3x-5x less pay</strong> than their Western counterparts, with fewer perks, <strong>less vacation</strong>, and the constant <strong>contract renewal threats</strong>.</p>
<p>And to add to their woes, the <strong>entry-level salaries</strong> at these GCCs have barely moved in the past <strong>15 years</strong>, despite inflation and the rising cost of living. It’s like getting a <strong>static variable</strong> in a <strong>dynamic world</strong>.</p>
<p>Plus, they have to <strong>sync up at 11 PM</strong> for calls with <strong>PST</strong> time zone clients who think that <strong>IST</strong> stands for <strong>"I’ll Slack Tomorrow."</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This post is a simple <strong>rant for the slump</strong> – not to be taken seriously. There are many more battles in tech, like <strong>open source vs. closed source</strong>, <strong>cloud vs. on-prem</strong>, and <strong>Windows vs. Mac</strong>. I’ll tackle those when the next writer’s block hits. 😉</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn CAP Theorem using Git and real-time React apps. A must-read bridge post for frontend engineers to understand distributed systems like software architects.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/cap-theorom-git-explained-ff26ca84a5fc10ba511287079503c346.webp" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p><strong>Why this post?</strong> As frontend engineers, we often focus narrowly on frameworks and tooling—primarily JavaScript, React, and UI libraries. But many of us hit a career plateau because we lack exposure to core software engineering principles.</p>
<p>This post is part of a growing genre I call <strong>“Bridge Posts”</strong>—connecting frontend development to foundational software architecture concepts. The goal is to help frontend engineers think like system designers, not just component builders.</p>
<p>Today, we explore the <strong>CAP Theorem</strong>, a classic principle in distributed systems, and map it to familiar frontend scenarios—such as Git workflows, real-time collaborative UIs, and offline-friendly apps.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="understanding-the-cap-theorem">Understanding the CAP Theorem<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends#understanding-the-cap-theorem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding the CAP Theorem" title="Direct link to Understanding the CAP Theorem" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In distributed systems, the <strong>CAP Theorem</strong> states that during a network partition (i.e., some parts of the system can’t communicate), you can only guarantee <strong>two of the following three</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency (C):</strong> All nodes see the same data at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Availability (A):</strong> Every request receives a response—regardless of the freshness of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Partition Tolerance (P):</strong> The system continues to operate even when parts of it can’t communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, <strong>partition tolerance</strong> is non-negotiable in any distributed system. Therefore, systems must choose between consistency and availability when partitions occur.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="git-analogy-you-already-use-cap">Git Analogy: You Already Use CAP<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends#git-analogy-you-already-use-cap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Git Analogy: You Already Use CAP" title="Direct link to Git Analogy: You Already Use CAP" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with Git—a tool every developer knows.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you commit locally on a plane, you’re in a <strong>partitioned state</strong>.</li>
<li>You can continue working (<strong>Availability</strong>), even though your code may diverge from your teammate’s (<strong>Consistency</strong> is compromised).</li>
<li>Once reconnected, you <strong>merge</strong> changes to restore consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Git is an AP (Available + Partition-Tolerant) system</strong>. It tolerates partitions and lets you work offline but eventually requires reconciliation.</p>

<p>Now imagine you’re building a collaborative form in React. Multiple users edit the same form in real-time. Updates are synchronized via WebSockets or polling.</p>
<p>How does CAP play out here?</p>

<ul>
<li>If a user loses network connectivity, editing is disabled.</li>
<li>This ensures everyone always sees the latest state.</li>
<li>However, the application becomes unavailable for offline or disconnected users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use cases:</strong> Healthcare apps, finance platforms—where data integrity is paramount.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can continue editing offline.</li>
<li>Changes are stored locally and synced later.</li>
<li>This may lead to <strong>conflicting edits</strong>, requiring merge strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use cases:</strong> Note-taking apps, chat applications—where user flow matters more than perfect sync.</p>

<p>A <strong>network partition</strong> occurs when different components of a distributed system—clients, services, or databases—cannot communicate due to a temporary network failure. Each component may still be operational, but they're isolated like islands without bridges.</p>
<p>In frontend development, this is surprisingly common:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user loses internet connectivity mid-session.</li>
<li>A mobile app hits a dead spot with no signal.</li>
<li>The frontend can reach a CDN or cache but not the main API server.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Designing for Partition Tolerance</strong> means your app should continue functioning as gracefully as possible, even during such disconnects.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="as-a-react-developer-this-involves">As a React developer, this involves:<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/explaining-cap-dvcs-multi-user-for-frontends#as-a-react-developer-this-involves" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to As a React developer, this involves:" title="Direct link to As a React developer, this involves:" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Storing user actions locally (memory, localStorage, IndexedDB).</li>
<li>Queuing mutations and syncing later (e.g., Service Workers, Apollo cache, Redux middleware).</li>
<li>Providing clear UI cues: “You’re offline, changes will sync later.”</li>
<li>Implementing conflict resolution logic, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figma</strong> continues rendering and recording user edits during disconnects.</li>
<li><strong>Notion</strong> lets you type offline and syncs the block tree later.</li>
<li><strong>Gmail</strong> stores draft emails offline and sends them once reconnected.</li>
</ul>
<p>These applications <strong>opt for Partition Tolerance</strong>, ensuring the app remains usable—even if consistency is delayed or temporarily broken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing for Partition Tolerance doesn’t mean ignoring consistency—it means accepting that consistency might be <em>eventual</em>, not immediate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In distributed systems, <strong>network failures are not rare edge cases—they're expected events.</strong> As frontend engineers, acknowledging and designing for them elevates your thinking from component trees to system-level resilience.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be building a distributed database to care about CAP. If your application:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caches remote data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lets users work offline</strong></li>
<li><strong>Supports multi-user collaboration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Relies on eventual consistency</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>…then you’re actively navigating CAP trade-offs.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can users work with stale data? → Choose <strong>Availability</strong>.</li>
<li>Must every write be accurate and conflict-free? → Prioritize <strong>Consistency</strong>.</li>
<li>Should the app always respond—even during outages? → Design for <strong>Partition Tolerance</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>“CAP isn’t just a backend concern—it manifests in every interactive, networked UI you build.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether you’re building a rich client with React Query, crafting optimistic updates, or designing for offline-first usage, you’re constantly making trade-offs. Understanding CAP helps you make them consciously.</p>
<p>This post was part of a broader mission to elevate frontend engineers into system thinkers—developers who don’t just build buttons, but design resilient user experiences.</p>
<p>Let’s not be cookie-cutter React developers. Let’s bridge the gap.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happens when a <strong>frontend architect meets a podium</strong> after years? You get a mix of <code>console.log("confidence")</code> and some seriously good speeches.</p>
<p>I'm <strong>dhbalaji</strong> — Lead Frontend Engineer by day, Toastmaster since 2012, and collector of certificates like <a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/docs/certifications/toastmasters/acb"><strong>CC</strong>, <strong>CL</strong>, and <strong>ACB</strong></a>. After taking a break to focus to master sorcerous Javascript. But when I heard there’s a <strong>Toastmasters Club right here in Hosur</strong>, my curiosity wanted me to do a little mic check.</p>
<p>So I walked in. Here's what happened.</p>

<p>Having attended clubs with bells, whistles, and near-TED levels of polish, <strong>Hosur Toastmasters</strong> felt refreshingly raw. Think: garage band with talent, waiting to hit Spotify.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Diverse Professionals:</strong> Engineers, finance folks, HR pros — all under one roof</li>
<li><strong>Mature Audience:</strong> 30s+ crowd added depth and real-life stories</li>
<li><strong>Warm Vibes:</strong> Received a formal invite ahead of time (yay structure!)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sunday morning?</strong> Great for early birds, rough for Netflix-bingers</li>
<li><strong>Limited networking:</strong> Hybrid format made hallway chats tough</li>
<li><strong>Retention Blues:</strong> Noticed some churn — fresh energy needed</li>
</ul>
<p>The session I attended was a <strong>joint meeting with Proficient Toastmasters Club</strong>, with quite a few tuning in online. Felt like an office teams meeting — but with better grammar.</p>

<p>I won’t pretend I was the General Evaluator, but here’s what stuck with me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong> <em>“Voices of Nature”</em> — poetic, calming, not a weather report</li>
<li><strong>Word of the Day:</strong> “<strong>Cacophony</strong>” — ironically, the meeting room fan was anything <em>but</em></li>
<li><strong>Prepared Speeches:</strong> Delivered with confidence — definitely mentor material</li>
<li><strong>Table Topics:</strong> Real-time adrenaline for guests. I spoke. I survived.</li>
<li><strong>TAG Team:</strong> Tracked <strong>Time</strong>, <strong>Ah-counter</strong>, and <strong>Grammar</strong> like ninjas with excel sheets, yes someone ended up sharing screen on teams</li>
<li><strong>Evaluations &amp; Awards:</strong> Encouragement with a touch of pageantry and photos</li>
<li><strong>Post-Meeting Chats:</strong> Surprisingly rich — could have been better</li>

<p>Here’s my candid guest audit (no PowerPoint, promise):</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce guests early — helps with context and connection</li>
<li>Bigger in-person crowd = more energy</li>
<li>Meeting decorum — a little polish goes a long way</li>
<li>Tighter meeting flow — less lag between segments</li>
<li><strong>Record &amp; upload speeches</strong> — boost visibility and speaker growth</li>

<p>This was the deal-sealer.</p>
<p>Where else do <strong>frontend developers, sales pros, finance strategists, and HR veterans</strong> talk about communication, confidence, and community — all in the same room?</p>
<p>Special shoutout to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muthuk-kalimuthu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TM Muthu Kalimuthu</strong></a>, the Club President. His hospitality and thoughtful questions before the meeting made me feel like I was already part of the team.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Break down the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs) using an easy-to-follow analogy of a doctor's clinic. Learn about tokenization, embeddings, transformer architecture, and more.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/doctor-patient-ai-illustration-01ba81e9b1cfc24251a3212175a35e3d.webp" width="1000" height="666" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the way we build intelligent applications—especially in frontend development. From ChatGPT to custom AI copilots, LLMs are everywhere. But have you ever wondered <strong>how LLMs actually work</strong> under the hood?</p>
<p>The theory behind LLMs can be complex—terms like <em>embeddings</em>, <em>transformers</em>, <em>tokenization</em>, and <em>vector space</em> often feel overwhelming. That’s why I’m using a familiar analogy: a visit to a <strong>local doctor’s clinic</strong>.</p>
<p>This blog post breaks down <strong>the internal architecture of LLMs</strong> using a real-world story that’s easy to visualize and remember. Whether you're a developer exploring AI integration, an engineer curious about embeddings, or someone building chat interfaces, this analogy-driven explanation will help you understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>What tokenization really means</li>
<li>Why vectors and embeddings are essential</li>
<li>How transformers "think" using attention</li>
<li>Why temperature affects LLM creativity</li>
<li>How memory and context shape outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s walk into the clinic. 🚶‍♂️💊</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="characters-in-the-community-clinic-example">Characters in the Community Clinic Example<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/understanding-llm-with-hospital-example#characters-in-the-community-clinic-example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Characters in the Community Clinic Example" title="Direct link to Characters in the Community Clinic Example" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>User</strong> – A person interacting with the LLM (the patient)</li>
<li><strong>LLM</strong> – The large language model (the doctor)</li>
<li><strong>Internals</strong> – Sequence of steps the model uses to generate a response (diagnostic workflow)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="step-1-patient-describes-the-issue-to-doctor">Step 1: Patient Describes the Issue to Doctor<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/understanding-llm-with-hospital-example#step-1-patient-describes-the-issue-to-doctor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Patient Describes the Issue to Doctor" title="Direct link to Step 1: Patient Describes the Issue to Doctor" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Scene:</strong><br>
<!-- -->The patient walks into the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doctor: Hi, please sit down.</li>
<li>Patient: Thank you.</li>
<li>Doctor: Tell me.</li>
<li>Patient: I got back from my friend’s wedding 2 days back. Since yesterday, I feel cold and have body pains.</li>
<li>Doctor: (listening) hmm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LLM Analogy:</strong><br>
<!-- -->This step is like <strong>tokenization</strong> — breaking the input sentence into smaller units (tokens) that the machine can understand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Tokenizer:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Converts input from human language to machine-readable tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Plain text / story</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Word tokens (e.g., "wedding", "cold", "pains")</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="step-2-doctor-comprehends-the-patient-problem">Step 2: Doctor Comprehends the Patient Problem<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/understanding-llm-with-hospital-example#step-2-doctor-comprehends-the-patient-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Doctor Comprehends the Patient Problem" title="Direct link to Step 2: Doctor Comprehends the Patient Problem" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The doctor interprets the patient’s words and thinks in terms of temperature, symptoms, etc. They may even order diagnostic tests for more data.</p>
<p><strong>LLM Analogy:</strong><br>
<!-- -->This is like the <strong>embedding layer</strong>, where word tokens are turned into number arrays (vectors) that hold semantic meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Embedding Layer:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Converts tokens into vector form for semantic understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Word tokens</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Vectors that represent meaning (like symptoms turned into medical data)</li>

<p>The doctor thinks through the problem using experience and logic—checking symptoms against patterns they’ve seen before.</p>
<p><strong>LLM Analogy:</strong><br>
<!-- -->This is the <strong>transformer architecture</strong>—especially self-attention layers, which compare words across the sentence to extract meaning and decide what matters most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Transformer Layers:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Deep learning steps like self-attention and feedforward networks.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Vectors</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Context-aware vectors based on internal learned patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>Doctors don’t always prescribe expensive tests—patient affordability, practicality, and history all affect decisions.</p>
<p><strong>LLM Analogy:</strong><br>
<!-- -->This step is like <strong>positional encoding</strong>—ensuring the model understands the order and structure of the sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 4 - Positional Encoding:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Adds position-related meaning to vectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Related vector tokens</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Ordered vector tokens based on sentence position</li>
</ul>

<p>The doctor now documents the diagnosis and treatment. It’s a direct result of structured thinking and patient input.</p>
<p><strong>LLM Analogy:</strong><br>
<!-- -->This is where the model <strong>decodes</strong> the internal vector into a predicted sequence of tokens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 5 - Decoder:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Generates output tokens based on model’s confidence and logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Positional vectors</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Probable tokens in correct context</li>

<p>The final interaction. If the patient is nervous, doctor might tweak the recommendation. This is where human nuance enters.</p>
<p><strong>LLM Analogy:</strong><br>
<!-- -->The LLM now converts tokens back into human-readable words. Here, <strong>temperature</strong> plays a role in how creative or safe the response is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 6 - Output Layer:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Converts final vector into output text based on temperature setting.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Final vector</li>
<li><strong>Output:</strong> Natural language sentence</li>

<p>LLMs with <strong>memory or context windows</strong> can remember prior conversations, like a doctor recognizing returning patients. This helps give better, contextual responses in multi-turn dialogues.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="summary">Summary<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2025/understanding-llm-with-hospital-example#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Just like a good doctor doesn’t Google your symptoms in front of you, a well-trained LLM doesn’t "think" in real-time. It applies complex math on pre-learned data to predict and autocomplete responses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Words → Tokens → Vectors → Patterns → Tokens → Words</strong></li>
<li>Everything happens in <strong>vector space</strong>, not in "language" as humans know it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re building with tools like <strong>LangChain</strong>, <strong>OpenAI</strong>, or <strong>embedding-powered RAG applications</strong>, understanding these LLM fundamentals gives you a huge advantage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🧠 "A well-trained LLM is just a super-fast autocomplete that has read the entire internet."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As tech enthusiasts, we often talk about <strong>to-do lists</strong> to stay productive. But have you ever considered the power of a <strong>not-to-do list</strong>? It's about consciously identifying habits or activities that no longer serve your goals and removing them. Here's my not-to-do list for 2025, crafted with the intent to stay focused, efficient, and aligned with my evolving priorities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="1-no-more-public-github-repos">1.

<p>Open-source contribution has been a cornerstone of the tech world, and I’ve had my share of excitement from it. But with the rise of AI tools, the landscape is changing. Unless you’re a core maintainer of a prominent library, the recognition that once came from showcasing code has diminished.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll shift my energy toward <strong>building meaningful products and functionalities</strong> rather than maintaining a public code showcase. The focus will be on solving problems and creating impact—where the real value lies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="2-no-social-media-overload">2. No Social Media Overload<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#2-no-social-media-overload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.

<p>Social media can be a double-edged sword. It’s a goldmine for networking, but it’s also a time sink designed for immersion and doomscrolling. With AI tools providing quick insights (even without sitting through a 40-minute video), my reliance on these platforms will be minimal.</p>
<p>Here’s my plan: <strong>Engage with social media just once a week for an hour</strong>, in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> for personal updates.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> for professional networking.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Feed</strong> to track industry trends.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter/X</strong> for niche topics and hot takes.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Subscriptions</strong> for targeted learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I’ll curate a list of websites to stay updated instead of depending on algorithm-driven feeds.</p>

No Two Visits Per Week To Office<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office" title="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Working from the office puts you into a routine which is a supporting stick for those who lack self discipline of waking up early, switching subjects under work naturally. Thats why I am against working from office on select days of the week.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="4-no-more-reading-goals">4. No More Reading Goals<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#4-no-more-reading-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals" title="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I used to pride myself on being a voracious reader, devouring two books a week. But life evolves, and so do habits. For two consecutive years, I failed to hit my reading goals—and that’s okay.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll stop setting rigid reading goals. Instead, I’ll use mobile apps that provide <strong>daily book summaries</strong> to stay updated with the latest titles. Physical books will still have a place in my collection, but the pressure to meet arbitrary goals will be a thing of the past.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="5-no-more-video-courses-unless-ive-tried-and-failed">5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#5-no-more-video-courses-unless-ive-tried-and-failed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed" title="Direct link to 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Video courses are everywhere—just one click away. But they often require hours of commitment, and many simply repackage information available in documentation or books.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll treat video courses as a <strong>last resort</strong>. I’ll prioritize <strong>reading documentation</strong>, <strong>experimenting</strong>, and leveraging AI for quick answers. If I still hit roadblocks, only then will I invest time in a course. The same logic applies to interviews or tutorials—AI can summarize key insights faster than a 60-minute watch.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-overall-theme-build-ship-and-upskill">The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#the-overall-theme-build-ship-and-upskill" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill" title="Direct link to The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>2025 is about <strong>action over abstraction</strong>. Instead of endlessly documenting best practices or creating small libraries, I’ll focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building real applications</strong> for my portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging AI for 5x upskilling</strong>.</li>
<li>Prioritizing <strong>actual product development</strong> over pre/post-work content.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to let go of distractions and double down on meaningful work. Here’s to a focused and fulfilling year ahead!</p>
<p>What’s on your <strong>not-to-do list</strong> for 2025? Share in the comments—I’d love to hear your thoughts!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>YouTube has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. From entertainment to education, it’s a treasure trove of information waiting to be tapped. However, like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By channeling our time on YouTube towards productive endeavors, we can unlock immense value. Here are three transformative lessons I’ve learned from YouTube in 2024, which have reshaped my perspective and enriched my life.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself">1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/things-learnt-from-youtube-2024#1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself" title="Direct link to 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than being technically inclined yet unable to handle minor repairs. For many, minor fixes—whether it’s a laptop issue or a motorcycle—are often overlooked by mechanics or seen as unworthy of their time. Insurance companies don’t cover such small mishaps, and for the owner, they’re just time-wasters. But learning to perform these tasks yourself is a game-changer.</p>
<p>Through YouTube, I’ve gained the confidence to tackle these challenges. DIY repair videos have become my go-to resource before making any major purchases. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most business-grade laptops have detailed repair tutorials available.</li>
<li>Popular vehicles, like Maruti cars, also have a wealth of content explaining common issues and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This newfound skill has transformed how I make purchase decisions. DIY repairability is now a core factor in my selection framework. The ability to fix things with my own hands not only saves money but also fosters a sense of independence and ownership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before buying any big or expensive item, check if it is DIY repair-friendly. It can save you a lot of hassle down the line.</p>

<p>Conversations around finance often revolve around trades, insurance, or IPOs, but rarely delve into overarching financial frameworks or strategies for building wealth. Thanks to YouTube, we can now access diverse perspectives and stories from people at different stages of their financial journey.</p>
<p>Just today, I watched two fascinating videos:</p>
<ol>
<li>A story about a betting addict burdened by debt—a cautionary tale of financial mismanagement.</li>
<li>The inspiring journey of a top-level executive who retired early to live sustainably on a farm. Their financial strategy included years of disciplined saving and investments, supplemented by income from startups. Here’s their asset allocation:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>40% in real estate, including their farm.</li>
<li>40% in equities and mutual funds.</li>
<li>10% in gold.</li>
<li>10% in liquid funds for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These narratives offer invaluable insights and practical frameworks for managing personal finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Before you quit your job, ensure you have a solid financial runway. Asset allocation is crucial for long-term stability.</p>

<p>For developers and tech enthusiasts, attending global conferences like Next.js Conf or Google I/O often seems like a distant dream. Enter YouTube, the ultimate equalizer. With live streams and recorded sessions, anyone, anywhere, can stay updated on the latest trends and technologies.</p>
<p>This year, I tuned into multiple tech events that would have been impossible to attend in person. These events not only kept me informed but also inspired me to stay ahead in my career. The ability to access these resources at your convenience is a game-changer for lifelong learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Don’t miss out on tech trends—attend virtual events and conferences through YouTube.</p>

<p>YouTube is undoubtedly a powerful platform for learning and growth. However, navigating it effectively requires discipline. The abundance of content can quickly lead to doom-scrolling and distractions if we’re not careful. By setting guardrails and focusing on purposeful content, we can turn YouTube into a tool for self-improvement.</p>

<p>The key to harnessing YouTube’s potential lies in intentionality. Whether it’s mastering DIY repairs, building financial acumen, or staying updated with industry trends, the platform offers endless opportunities. Use it wisely, and you’ll find yourself growing in ways you never imagined.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warranty claims in India can feel like navigating the internet with a shaky connection. Sometimes you get a swift <strong>200 OK</strong>, and other times you're stuck in an endless loop of <strong>408 Request Timeout</strong> or redirected to <strong>303 See Other Agency for Warranty</strong>. As a tech blogger and frontend developer, I thought it’d be fun to break down this often frustrating yet essential consumer process using HTTP status codes as a metaphor.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="what-the-heck-is-a-warranty">What the Heck is a Warranty?<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#what-the-heck-is-a-warranty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?" title="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving in, let's understand the basics. Warranty is a form of consumer protection where a company promises to replace or repair a product if it malfunctions within a specified period. Think of it as a service-level agreement between you and the brand, like <strong>12 months of uptime guarantee</strong> for your shiny new "Bonda" mobile charger.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="but-its-not-always-a-200-ok">But It’s Not Always a <strong>200 OK</strong>...<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" title="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>If companies approved every warranty claim without scrutiny, they'd be out of business. So, they create hurdles to ensure only genuine claims get through. For us consumers, this means our warranty experience can range from seamless to outright bizarre.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-http-status-code-guide-to-warranty-claims">The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#the-http-status-code-guide-to-warranty-claims" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims" title="Direct link to The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="200-ok-positive-case"><strong>200 OK</strong>: Positive Case<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#200-ok-positive-case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 200-ok-positive-case" title="Direct link to 200-ok-positive-case" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The consumer submits a claim with a valid invoice, and the company processes it smoothly.<br>
<!-- -->For example, my experience with a Transcend pen drive's lifetime warranty was flawless. I handed in the old one at their warehouse and walked out with a replacement. <strong>No drama, just resolution.</strong> I wish every claim was like this!</p>

<p>Instead of resolving your issue directly, the brand redirects you to a third-party service center. This often happens with products bought online. Hello, Amazon warranty maze!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="304-untouched-were-looking-into-it"><strong>304 Untouched (We’re Looking Into It)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#304-untouched-were-looking-into-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 304-untouched-were-looking-into-it" title="Direct link to 304-untouched-were-looking-into-it" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>You’ve submitted your claim, but the company keeps responding with, “Our team will get back to you soon.” Weeks pass, but nothing changes. Classic cached response with no updates.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty"><strong>305 Use Proxy (Only the First Owner Gets Warranty)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty" title="Direct link to 305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Some motorcycle companies require warranty claims to be made by the original owner. If you’ve bought the motorcycle second-hand, tough luck finding the first owner or kiss the warranty goodbye.</p>

<p>Misplaced your receipt? No original box? Missing serial number? Your claim is denied.<br>
<!-- -->Pro tip: Keep the computer generated bill of your purchases and warranty details in your locker.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online"><strong>401 Unauthorized (You Bought It Online)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online" title="Direct link to 401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Some brands deny warranty for products bought on open-market platforms or unauthorized dealers. It's their way of saying, <em>“You didn’t play by our rules.”</em></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="402-payment-required-hidden-costs"><strong>402 Payment Required (Hidden Costs)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#402-payment-required-hidden-costs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 402-payment-required-hidden-costs" title="Direct link to 402-payment-required-hidden-costs" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>While the product part might be under warranty, labor or transportation costs aren’t. Parcel charges for small items like chargers can sometimes exceed the product’s value. Talk about irony!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period"><strong>403 Forbidden (Out of Warranty Period)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period" title="Direct link to 403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Your claim is automatically rejected because you missed the warranty window. Companies rarely extend grace periods, so you're on your own now.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="404-not-found-company-disappeared"><strong>404 Not Found (Company Disappeared)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#404-not-found-company-disappeared" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 404-not-found-company-disappeared" title="Direct link to 404-not-found-company-disappeared" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Online brands often vanish faster than seasonal discounts. By the time your product fails, the company’s customer support or even the brand itself is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Warranty claims for damage caused by misuse are promptly denied. Spilled coffee on your laptop? Dropped your phone? The terms and conditions were crystal clear. This one's on you.</p>

<p>Some companies require you to upload videos or images of the defect, often in specific formats. If you can’t reproduce the issue on camera, your claim is stuck.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="426-upgrade-required-let-me-upsell-you"><strong>426 Upgrade Required (Let Me Upsell You)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#426-upgrade-required-let-me-upsell-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 426-upgrade-required-let-me-upsell-you" title="Direct link to 426-upgrade-required-let-me-upsell-you" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Instead of resolving your claim, companies push you to buy a newer model. It's like saying, “Why fix your old phone when you can upgrade to this shiny new one?”</p>

<p>Claiming a warranty in India can be as unpredictable as an HTTP request to a flaky server. From <strong>200 OK</strong> to <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>, your experience depends on the brand, product, and sometimes sheer luck. But with a little preparation and a lot of patience, you can improve your odds.</p>
<p>Remember, warranty claims might not always bring you joy, but at least now you can laugh about them through the lens of HTTP status codes! Hope my article also clarifies if you need to buy extened warranty. That was a good tip if you read till the last line !!.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solar water heaters have become a common sight in households, especially in southern India where the weather is ideal for harnessing solar energy. With over five years of experience dealing with solar heaters, both in my home and those of friends, I've gathered some insights on the advantages, disadvantages, and cost savings associated with these systems.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="3-advantages-of-having-a-solar-water-heater">3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-reasons-not-to-buy-solar-water-heater-india#3-advantages-of-having-a-solar-water-heater" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater" title="Direct link to 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instant Hot Water No need to turn on the geyser and wait for it to heat up. For families with many members, this is a game-changer. My family has become accustomed to having instant hot water 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced Electricity Bill Using solar energy means you save on electricity costs since you’re not using the electric geyser to heat water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient Use of Solar Energy Apart from drying clothes, it's a great way to utilize solar energy efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="3-downsides-of-having-a-solar-water-heater">3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-reasons-not-to-buy-solar-water-heater-india#3-downsides-of-having-a-solar-water-heater" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater" title="Direct link to 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Despite the benefits, there are notable challenges with continuous ownership:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Water Shortages During summer, water shortages are common. If your overhead tank runs dry, the solar tank can't cool down, leading to cracked or broken glass tubes. If a glass tube breaks, water gushes out, potentially damaging other tubes due to the solar tank being almost empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vacation Planning When going on vacation, ensure your overhead tank is full. If it runs dry due to evaporation, leaks, or usage, your solar heater could be damaged. Issues like monkey problems, stones, or aerial firecrackers can also break the glass tubes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plumbing, Tank Quality, and Hard Water The long-term success of a solar water heater depends on these factors. Hard water requires periodic servicing, which can cost around ₹2500. Some solar tanks, made of steel alloys, can corrode and leak. The heat from the solar tank can deform pipes, so consult with plumbers about pipe quality. Hard water exacerbates these issues, damaging water-carrying devices.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="day-1-of-react-nexus-2024">Day 1 of React Nexus 2024<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/react-nexus-2024-good-parts#day-1-of-react-nexus-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 of React Nexus 2024" title="Direct link to Day 1 of React Nexus 2024" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>The first speaker was Naman Goel, spoke about "Designing for design: API decisions for long-term success". Naman is a maintainer at <a href="https://stylexjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleX JS</a> at Meta. He spoke about the design decisions, importance of inspiration and lineage in developing libraries and quick demos of stylex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish your side project to be successful. I do not think this needs any explaination. Simple advice yet profound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React was inspired by functional programming so hooks were inevitable and a natural progression. The same inspiration is a hidden force in stylex JS as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of ReactJS be like.. React create class --&gt; JSX --&gt; Real classes --&gt; Functional Components --&gt; hooks --&gt; React server components..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conference talk idea. "Algebraic effects". This is a react concept which is discussed on <a href="https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Blog</a> and referenced in Naman Goel speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade offs help us to reach the sweet spot in design decisions. I cant agree more, without tradeoff programming would be simply hard for many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React fiber underwent a complete rewrite 8 years ago due to which we are able to add further enhancements to React like hooks, React Server Components (RSC), etc. Its always a good value add to hear directly from maintainers at Meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second speaker Nurul Sundarani, spoke about "Beyond the Backend: The Rise of React Server Components". He gave a lightning introduction to React Server Components (RSC in short) and how we can use them with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the era of RSC, every frontend developer will be a fullstack developer too. Tools like Prisma should help you with that transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSC can directly talk to databases, render only on the server so they can have API keys, good for SEO as the HTML and CSS alone can add value to the web crawlers, make the website quick by avoiding render fetch, etc.. The list goes on. Bottomline learn RSC ASAP. Good for you and your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third speaker Akash Hamirwasia, spoke about "Enhancing your Static Sites with React Server Components". Yes, RSC can be used on the static website. Sounds contrary? then read on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://akashhamirwasia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Static websites</a> too run on a server and RSC can make use of the file server to do more. I was not able to find the code on Speaker Github but you need to know that its a possibility to do RSC on static websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was impressed with ease and confidence with which the relatively young speaker Akash was able to put his point across the room. While I was watching his speech, I was convinced without a doubt. Bottomline, the speaker had exceeding levels of communications skills and confidence. Sometimes you pick up a thing or two non tech skills in a tech conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Stefinie Fernando spoke about "Building Secure React Apps with Choreo IDevP". The software Choreo had some similarity with GCP app engine. In choreo the role of the developer ends with commiting code and packaging app into a image. The rest is taken care by Choreo platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Choreo platform boasts of complete software development cycle support ranging from CI/CD to deployment on a cluster. To playaround, visit <a href="https://wso2.com/choreo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choreo website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next JS which is a react framework has good levels of RSC support. Other react frameworks like remix are not behind. Think RSC, think react frameworks. RSC have friends too, they are called React server actions. <code>use server</code> directive, heard of it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If there were one word that was repeated a lot during react nexus 2024, it would be RSC</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22">
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Vamshi Suram spoke about "Scalable mock data injection into Apollo (GraphQL) Client". Overall the speaker was confortable on stage talking about his open source project <a href="https://github.com/intuit/apollo-mock-http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apollo-mock-http</a> which helps us with data mocking even in enterprise level applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mocking should be done away from application layer so that they can be toggled with a feature switch. This is not advice specific to apollo client but frontend in general. I like this application design pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good mocking should not hinder or interfere with UI rendering because you loose out on the UI interactivity and animation. This advice is given with the context of react components where devs set data to props directly to mock the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fifth speaker Sweta Tanwar spoke about "Defensive Development: Testing Tactics for React Native Resilience". This was the first speech referencing React Native in React Nexus 2024. The content was actionable and could easily be blown up into a full book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defensive application development can be broken into 3 categories. Code practices, Testing and CI/CD automation. More details in the next thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code practices include code quality checks, error handling with graceful degradation and error boundaries, component isolation before testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing practices include Unit testing with Jest, Integration testing with Enzyme and E2E testing with Detox/Appium. On react we are mostly talking about React testing with Vitest and playwright testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pyramid visualization was used to show that an app needs more unit tests which are efficient and integration testing at the top of the pyramid which are comprehensive. The pyramid slide will be referenced in my future discussions with architects on why unit, e2e and integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD automation of tests can be done to catch regression issues in a automated fashion. We can use tools like circle CI, Travis, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sixth Speaker Rajat Vijay spoke about "Experiments with AI-Generated Tests". I see the testing theme, pre lunch to be a good idea. Good job organizers. I can sense that Rajat has seen good amount of tests in his career. He clearly outlined the problem with Copilot generated tests and how he intends to fix them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat mentioned a tool titled "auto guardian" which instructs AI tools about the expected quality and style of testing. It looks like a config file for AI testing. I feel this would bring uniformity in the AI testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat spilled a few interview questions. userEvent vs fireEvent? Whats the difference and which is better. getByRole vs getByText. I will write a blog about these topics soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat referenced <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.promptingguide.ai/</a> to understand more about writing better prompts. I believe the future auto guardian would refer to these prompting standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testing demo was fun to watch and clearly the quality of tests can be increased greatly. The link to github repo is broken. Rajat plz toggle the repo to public if its private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seventh speaker were from freshworks, spoke about "AI-Assisted Development: Harnessing the Freshworks Freddy Copilot Toolkit for App Development". The second sponsor speech on day 1. Its interested to see the no code movement gaining steam. Developers can build a full fledged application with a few apps and monetise on the platform. Thats insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Freedy Copilot had lot of similarities with github copilot. It needed registration, installation on vs code, type your requirement on chat. Freedy can also deploy to their marketplace. Finally no code app generation is in reach / at times free to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The different stages from an idea to app. Requirements gathering, design, implemenation &amp; refactoring, testing can be handled by Freedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedy can also build UI for the developers based on the prompt. frontend engineers, gulp it down. Yes AI can build UI. Freedy relies on vision models for generating UI for freshworks marketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The engineering behind Freedy copilot was also discussed by second presenter Nagaraj. All I could injest into my mind were LLM, AI and more of it. Finally Day 1 Lunch hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post lunch first session featured a panel discussion comprising none other than the react core team from meta, how cool is that. We had Satya talk about the working on React compiler. Yes I heard it for the first time. I know only about React fiber but React compiler is a thing. True to its name, it compiles your react app into something sophisticated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The react compiler could potentially free us from writing useMemo and useCallback as the compiler could do better code optimization compared to a normal developer. However if the compiler identifies a tricky code or hacky code, it will assume that developer is the best judge and shall not mess with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In React 19, ref is a regular prop. I hope to miss forwardExoticComponentRef in my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a short and sweet answer to breaking changes, if you had been following the modern standards of react development. Then there are no breaking changes that should bother you. So legacy app developers brace yourself, modern app developers rejoice and upgrade to react 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eslint plugin for react is now updated and optimized for react compiler. However there are many bugs that could escape the eslint and get inferred by React compiler. Code better and do not just trust eslint for react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React Strict DOM (RSD) is an integration of React DOM and StyleX, aiming to streamline and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native targets. We had Stylex maintainer Naman Goel talk about the possibilities of RSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversation quickly moved towards RSC (React Server Components) best practices. Don't waste time hydrating components that are not read/used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Render as you fetch or fetch as you render? An another interview question to note. The panel favoured Render as you fetch as mentioned this is how apps to be built be it RSC or RN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use operator is used for reading resources outside of the render. However it being a panel discussion, no demo or code was shown about the use operator. An another speech topic for potential speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road ahead for react team looks like this. Compilation improvements, eslint plugin updates, lot of tooling related work is expected. I remember panel mentioning NextJS, Remix, etc. The panel discussion felt short but Tapas (the moderator) was well prepared with sharp questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eighth speaker Prateek Surana spoke about "Elevate your routing game with TanStack Router". Definitely I felt slightly outdated or an idiot for not use tanstack router after his demo. The power and relevance for enterprise use cases were amazing and would prevent developers from reinventing the wheel around routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tanstack router is file based, which is easy to understand and relatively hard to scale. To me the most killer feature was auto filter param rename in runtime. Let us say if param was misspelled, tanstack query can correct it for us without breaking the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall tanstack tools are squarely built around scaled react usecases which is beyond a simple ecommerce use case. I recommend checking out other tanstack tools and I am also excited to see how the tanstack fullstack comes out to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nineth speaker Palak Bansal spoke about "Mastering Image Optimization Techniques for Web Performance in React Applications". Let us face it, images can be hard to optimize and Addy osmani has written a book about it. Palak rightly hit the nail on the head by telling "Best practices keep changing which makes image optimization harder"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadly there are 3 image optimization techniques that were discussed. They are lazy loading, responsive  images and image CDN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lazy loading can be done on the <img> tag with a attribute called lazy. The responsive images can be based on width of the client or pixel density of the client. Image cdn can be self managed or third party cdn which generate images on the fly specially for the client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are wondering if the talk around image optimization is not as comprehensive as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/image-optimization-pre-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addy Osmani</a> book, you are right. This is a small talk format, some speeches are smaller than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenth speaker Jerad Rutnam spoke about "Simplify React App Login". The reasons for having a login feature are access control and personalization. But having a solid authentication logic can be hard and there were the sponsor of the event pitched his humble React component which was part of <a href="https://wso2.com/asgardeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asgardeo sdk</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of Asgardeo team, the recommendation from Jerad was to delegate complex parts of the app and focus on business logic implementation which could be your goto market strategy. Cannot deny if everyone had good budget, flexibility in the code and restrictions around data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eleventh speaker Apurv Khare spoke about "Flashpoint Performance". Is that even a thing or library or concept? Before I could stop wondering, the speaker was sprinting at the speed of flash with his speech. Lots of concepts discussed and I had tough time writing down the ideas from his speech. But the speaker knew his tools and he explained with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure performance first and optimize later. The speaker took us through different categories of performance metrics like Browser metrics, Core web vitals, Lab data &amp; Field data. The optimization techniques include compression techniques, optimizing JS, optimizing CSS, resource hints and optimized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker idea was to give a crash course on measure performance and also optimizing the performance with some numbers/reports from the tools wherever required. But I do not think the speaker showed us any tool called flashpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browser metrics - Time To First Byte (TTFB), Speed Index. Core web vitals / User experience metrics - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Latest Shift (CLS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here are some of the tools to measure website performance. App run at lab condition / lab data - Lighthouse, webpage test. App run at field condition / field data - Chrome UX report (CrUX), Pagespeed insights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network waterfall was well discussed with webpageTest and web vitals were discussed. The important performance concept, Critical Rendering Path was discussed. Of course, the speaker mentioned how CSSOM is built and how its different from JS DOM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website performance testing on first load vs repeat load was interesting to me because we generally measure the first load only. Wherever flat text files or documents are served from server to client, we must enable one of the gzip, brottli or other compression techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For optimizing JS - Pause blocking JS, defer it as much as possible. For Optimizing CSS - download CSS ASAP on the device in one chunk so that CSSOM gets built and the user can see the content rendered. Use resource hints like rel, as to pre load the content before it gets used. When prefetching multiple resources, use fetch priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day 1 post noon, performance speeches continue. The 12th speaker and last speaker of the day was Saurabh Daware and he spoke about "Debugging Performance Issues of Your Website". The previous speech was theoretical and this speech was practical to the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance issues are like any other bugs, for debugging performance issues just do not put a break point. The first place to look for is the network waterfall whenever we face an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker was running a static site featuring Razorpay landing page, he demonstrated First Contentful Paint and Last Contentful Paint. The speaker attempted to showcase perceived performance optimization and how his attempted interfered with other metrics like LCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker showcased how he cleverly chose to improve the perceived performance by booting the webcontainer only when code gets focus, until that point he shows the static output which gives the user the perception of fast. Its kind of fake it until you make it logic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="day-2-of-react-nexus-2024">Day 2 of React Nexus 2024<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/react-nexus-2024-good-parts#day-2-of-react-nexus-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024" title="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<ol start="72">
<li>
<p>Day 2 felt somewhat slow to me as we did not waste time at registration desk. But things took a turn when we begun the day 2 with a lightening talk about Yoga. The speaker gave a mini talk focussed on breathing, expanding spine length and some posture correction tips. We need to take 10 minutes a day to see the difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key exercises mentioned were neck stretches, breathing slow and deep, shoulder roll, cat cow pose while sitting. If you are yoga geek, then Tadasana and Garudasana were mentioned. If you feel stiff like wood, then remember range of motion increases with consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 13th speaker Alex Lobera spoke about "Future-proofing state management at scale". He showcased the app he works on "Miro" and there is definitely lot of user state, sync state happening in the app. The app looks like scrum board and renders on canvas/webGL based on the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author somehow connected the PHP era with RSC era. We were essentially connecting to DB and building UI all in one php file. We are doing the same in RSC. Just the server was not in the picture during SPA era and now its back. Congrats, everyone is now a full stack engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client can access server state but server cannot access client state. The server is coming back to the picture, this time its different. The server can help us build a state in RSC era. fyi day 2 had lot of speakers flying into India for the conference. Alex was from Portugal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 14th speaker Tapas Adhikary spoke about "Do You Really Need React Query For Your Applications?". I was one of the user of React Query and I got hooked. The real threat to React Query was change in context due to RSC. Now the client can talk to DB directly. However for complex use cases we might still need tanstack query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 15th speaker K Kamalakannan spoke about "Simplifying Complex Logic: Leveraging XState in React Development". I appreciate the state machine part, orchestration and visualization aspect of XState.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th speaker Ankit Tailor spoke about "How I built a Powerful Typed System?". He had worked on a design sytem called gluestack where he has authored CSS in JS which needs to be type safe. I could appreciate the use case for generic data types in designing type systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker mentions different aspects of DX like linting, debugging tools, typescript type checks and he showcased a CLI diagnostic tool which could show the size of generated types file which is absolutely needed for performance reasons. npx tsc --diagnostics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th and 17th speaker were Mike Grabowski &amp; Eric Vicenti speaking about a new paradigm "How you can Server-Render without Rendering on the Server". At the core we are trying to use web sockets to communicate with client UI on realtime to render changes. The use case was showcases interactively like a theatre play by 2 speaker on the stage with live coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speakers showcased their npm component library which could react to our code listening via WS protocol. The links to the code or library cannot be found on google. Watch out for <a href="https://rise.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rise.tools</a>. Not just the rendering library, rise.tools also has a component library so that developers can quickly build apps along with a playground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 18th speaker Sanket Sahu spoke about "Building Back-End Driven Universal Apps". Conceptually Sanket is attempting to solve the same problem as Mike &amp; Eric. Instead of too much code which looks like config. We have syntactically simpler code which can be generated by chatgpt to a very high level of accuracy. Thats in line with no code development of the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 19th speaker Shruti Arya spoke about "Measuring UI performance at scale". The talk was mostly about React native app on low end android devices. The github project was called component-profiler. Surprisingly I could not catch hold of the link to it. The goal was to prevent long re-renders so that there is no jankiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 20th speaker Santosh Yadav spoke about "Improve your Developer Experience with Nx". When the pain point that Nx tries to fill was lengthy build times on any machine, be it CI/CD or cloud or local. The NX tool intelligently creates a graph of the code and precisely knows the impact of the code change. Then runs the required build tasks instead of running every single build step on the entire code base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 21st speaker Apoorv Taneja spoke about "Creating beautiful experiences with Framer-Motion on web". <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framer motion</a> helps anyone without indepth css knowledge build animations. The speaker precisely showed us how to use framer to create interactivity on the UI components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 22nd speaker Yashpreet Bathla spoke about "Avoid flickering user interfaces". The presentation deck resembled windows 95 and it was amazing. The speaker explained the concepts like call stack, micro task queue, macro task queue and render queue in detail. He also mentioned the need to maintain 60FPS, and one render in 16.6ms to have a jank free interface. He also showed how using useLayoutEffect helps in preventing jankiness when compared to useEffect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 23rd speaker Mohit Kumar Toshniwal spoke about "Building XR applications using React Three Fiber". As speaker rightly said, the AR/VR usage has increased. Be it shopping on amazon or navigating with google maps. We can build AR/VR apps in react with react three fiber, drei, leva, react-xr etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then a panel discussion follows but this time the theme is state of react native. Panelists mentioned that react native is yet to reach v1.0.0. The expo eco system is quite mature and visiting expo.new is the way to get started with React native.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 24th speaker Neha Sharma spoke about "Connecting Worlds: Enhancing Accessibility in React Native TV Applications". Her talk was more about building accessible react native apps for smart TVs. On the mobile, the accessible is missing unlike accessible semantic html. This calls for more empathy from react native developers. The attributes like accessible are must have to make app accessible on TVs. The speaker reiterated that accessiblity is hard, its not a requirement but a feature to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 25th speaker Siddharth Kshetrapal spoke about Building accessible reusable react components. Having worked at primer.style, he is proficient in comprehending accessiblity issues and uses his tech speaker skills to make it interesting and understandable to audience. The speaker used 2 commonly used github widgets and tried to make them accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Siddharth referenced the importance of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APG</a> over WCAG in some use cases. he cleverly used the voice over to illustrate the pain, which the disabled people undergo due to our incorrect coding. I was thrilled and hooked to this speech, will certain share this speech to A11 enthusiasts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I watched the react documentary trailer for the first time and happy to see the people behind React and the collective team spirit. You should watch it too, I mean the full video on youtube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"How A Small Team of Developers Created React at Facebook | React.js: The Documentary"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsors were unintrusive, I was not bored by their presence on the stage or at the booth. Both of them answered the questions earnestly. The Freedy developer, aka AI tool for freshworks marketplace developers booth at the conference was showering goodies to the successful quiz winners and they had a lucky draw too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Asgardio platform which is a simple managed Authentication platform for developers conducted a workshop post the day 1 session which I felt was a generous  offering for attendees. The choreo platform which was an another stall was a useful utility for individual developers and small teams who want to have managed backend service. I love their stickers and pens kept for visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience were diverse in terms of demographics and their roots. Some of them were from students at Scalar academy, managers at Microsoft, founders of companies and in between. The Javascript community is quite strong like a giant multinational company having its subsidaries for their interests. We have JS Lovers, Chennai React, Delhi React, React Day Bangalore, team shiksha, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emcee Jobs are hardest and demands Charisma. Aakansha Doshi was simply bold and energetic. The cardio session to beat the sleep was a masterstroke by Aakansha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From timely humor to manager jokes, the second emcee Sahil Kalyani was equally charismatic on the stage. The third emcee Yashraj Nayak, whom I would remember for "how is the josh" was unique. He had deep connections with speakers and he was able to discuss some enjoyable anecdotes from his experience working with the speaker. Lastly "How is the Josh?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one last thing would be the presentation aids prepared by the tech speakers were spellbound. I would appeciate the amount of time, thought and content the speakers have put into the presentations aids / PPT material. I could not differentiate if its online editor or powerpoint tools or excalidraw or just 10x creative powers of the speakers who were frontend engineers.</p>
</li>

<p>Thats enough about react nexus and my commentary on React nexus 2024, have a good day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is when things turn awry for me. As a seller I pay delivery charges based on multiple factors like location of the seller and how far the location is relative to the seller location. As a seller I have no visibility on if the customer is a prime member or not. Neither any discounts on prime are shown to me. As a seller, I have to factor in the delivery charges in the MRP or collect separate delivery fees. As a amazon prime member if I buy the product, I am already paying for the delivery charge which is factored into the pricing by the seller.</p>
<p>If a non amazon prime member does the purchase below the threshold, then the amazon customer has to pay delivery charges twice because the seller has already factored in, the delivery charges along with the cost price and profit.</p>
<p>But Amazon prime members are not really given any "Free Delivery" as promised, its just a waive off of an platform charge associated with Amazon. The 1499 per year is not a discount voucher for delivery charges. In fact, you might have noticed that some products are less than 50 INR in physical stores like pens but on Amazon they are 150Rs etc because of the delivery charges.</p>
<p>Overall the delivery charges are unavoidable on any ecommerce platform and diminishes the value of the sales if the shopper is not careful. To be careful, the shopper need to be aware of the prices in the real world.</p>

<ol>
<li>Both Amazon Prime and Non Prime members bear the shipping charges directly and indirectly</li>
<li>As a online shopper, think of the value of the shopping transaction before you close the purchase along with myriad other quality and other concerns.</li>

<p>In the army, the personnel are called soldiers. In tech companies, the personnel are called resources. The army trains in camps and carries weapons. Resources work in offices, GCC, and carry laptops. In 2020 due to covid pandemic outbreak, the resources were asked to work from home. Thats how the resources experienced work from home lifestyle, the episode started. Fast forward 2024, the resources are asked to leave behind the work from home and come back to office marking the end of episode work from home, lovingly called the WFH.</p>
<p>Some companies went the extra mile and allowed the resources to work from anywhere forever. In a similar time frame, I wrote an article about <a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working#what-is-the-difference-between-wfh-and-remote-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work from home vs remote working</a>. The key takeaway was that working from home was a temporary fix unless the company adopted the culture mentioned in the book <a href="https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-remote-office-not-required/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote, Office Not Required</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of 2024, almost all companies have given a first call, second call, or in some cases, a final call asking resources to get back to working from the office. This means that the comfort of working from home and the associated lifestyle is no more. But there have to be a few reasons why the back-to-office movement is happening. Of course, there are many reasons; here are a few as quoted by management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office">Reasons to get back to the office<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/from-home-comforts-to-office-the-end-of-episode-WFH#reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office" title="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Covid is out of the picture; we can get back to the old way of working from the office. Our senior management is already doing it.</li>
<li>Operating in silos or as small teams won't boost the morale of the team or the culture of the company.</li>
<li>Use the office as a space to build your personal brand.</li>
<li>Please come to the office and use the building; we have purchased or leased it already for the long term. We have made it better in the recent renovation.</li>
<li>The economy depends on your return to the office; the cab drivers, janitors, and realtors need you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you ask me, except for the first reason, the others should not be taken seriously.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="how-management-is-pulling-resources-back-to-the-office">How management is pulling resources back to the office<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/from-home-comforts-to-office-the-end-of-episode-WFH#how-management-is-pulling-resources-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How management is pulling resources back to the office" title="Direct link to How management is pulling resources back to the office" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The company-wide call announcing mandatory work from the office for a minimum of 3 days.</li>
<li>Check if employees have punched into the office for a minimum of 3 days or 50% of working days.</li>
<li>Bring in a policy that allows reduced pay for people working remotely.</li>
<li>Bring in another policy that values presence in the office. No promotion if not working from the office. Personally, this statement is dangerous. Companies pay higher salaries to retain employees and not out of obligation. Having said that, more salary reduction could mean being on the layoff list.</li>
<li>In-office meetings and not having the option for online participation from WFH resources.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>In late 2020, after analyzing the implementation of WFH, it was clear that this was a temporary arrangement.</li>
<li>I condemn the press statements and town hall speeches by the management of tech companies in favor of working from anywhere. Everyone believed that working from home would continue forever.</li>
<li>Later in 2023, the management was the first to step into the office, followed by their immediate teams. This set an example for the whole company that working from the office is the way to conduct business.</li>
<li>Working from the office could mean perks like team lunches and client visits happening soon. Good for those with passports ready.</li>
<li>Companies need to be mindful about the transition and set the deadlines accordingly. Some employees were working in their pyjamas for long hours at home. In the work-from-office arrangement, they will waste time commuting, etc.</li>
<li>I am surprised when no management person said that working from the office is an opportunity for osmosis of ideas, easy to mentor juniors, or have fun moments. It looks like none of these happen at the workplace anymore or have been forgotten because of insufficient use.</li>
</ol>

<p>One person got into an argument where he refused to take the laptop home in the work-from-office arrangement, which led to tensions at the workplace. Accept that no system is perfect and software has bugs. In a long career span of 40 years, anything can happen. Many trends come and go.</p>
<p>We lived the WFH moment; it's time to move on.</p>]]></content:encoded>
