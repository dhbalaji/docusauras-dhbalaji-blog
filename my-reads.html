<p>Here&#x27;s a booktalk for &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Legacy: A Financial Planner for Your Loved Ones&quot; by Monika Halan.</p>
<p>2024 was an incredible year for my reading journey, especially in the realm of personal finance. Among the many books I read, one that truly stands out is &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Legacy: A Financial Planner for Your Loved Ones&quot; by Monika Halan. This book has become an essential addition to my financial library.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a work book which goes into bank locker and not your bookshelf</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Anticipation and Initial Reactions</strong></p>
<p>I eagerly followed this book from its pre-launch phase, but it initially left some young readers disappointed. They had certain expectations for a financial book, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear algorithmic or logical process.</li>
<li>Over 225 pages of paperback content.</li>
<li>A Bollywood-style happy ending that makes you feel like you&#x27;ve achieved your Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What the Book Actually Offers</strong></p>
<p>However, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Legacy&quot; offers something different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 20 pages of insightful content and over 100 pages of practical worksheets.</li>
<li>A focus on planning for the inevitable, rather than achieving FIRE goals.</li>
<li>Encouraging active participation with pen and paper, rather than simply clicking a payment button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite facing early criticism and poor reviews, the book has reversed trend and earned its rightful place on the bookshelves.</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Read This Book?</strong></p>
<p>This book is a must-read for anyone who believes in the importance of insurance products. Let&#x27;s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>We buy insurance to ensure our family&#x27;s well-being during unforeseen events.</li>
<li>But what if our assets remain inaccessible?</li>
<li>What if we haven’t made a will, added relevant nominees, or even discussed insurance within the family?</li>
</ul>
<p>This book aims to help you get organized, making it easier for your loved ones to access your assets when you are no longer around.</p>

<p>We often overcomplicate security measures, password-protecting everything from phones to lockers. The author suggests a simpler method: write down all necessary details in the provided worksheets and store the book in a secure place or bank locker. When your nominees access the locker, they will find everything neatly laid out.</p>

<p>Create an inventory of all types of assets on the worksheets provided in the book with verbose details, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank accounts</li>
<li>Real estate</li>
<li>Stocks and securities</li>
<li>Collectibles</li>
<li>Government documents like passports</li>
</ul>

<p>A will is essential for anyone with assets and above the age of 18. It specifies how you want to distribute your assets after you pass away. The author provides a template for creating a will, making the process straightforward.</p>

<p>This book isn&#x27;t about making money through tactical or strategic methods. Instead, it&#x27;s about ensuring your wealth is passed on smoothly to your loved ones. It&#x27;s not a book for passive reading but an interactive guide that requires you to sit down with a pen and paper. Remember to update the worksheets regularly. This book&#x27;s place is in your locker, not just on your bookshelf.</p>
<p>So, if you&#x27;re looking for a practical and thoughtful guide to planning your financial legacy, <em>&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Legacy&quot;</em> is a must-read!</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/my-reads/19">Grit The Power of Passion and Perseverance by Angela Duckworth</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-11-25T15:30:00.000Z">November 25, 2024</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/grit-book-46138ba4cb5bd68cb6d2f9f141d9a13b.webp" width="1490" height="2348" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>“One of the lines I heard on the internet: Recreation is overrated.” That sentiment, while seemingly harsh, encapsulates how the top performers of any field approach life. They don’t fold under pressure, they don’t abandon their goals when the going gets tough, and they certainly don’t leave projects hanging when distractions show up on their phone. Angela Duckworth’s Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance is a profound reminder of what it takes to excel.</p>
<p>There are no shortcuts, quick strategies, or shiny tools sold here. This book is about one thing: putting in the work. And it makes you believe that consistent effort, not just talent, turns ordinary individuals into rock stars.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="who-should-read-this-book">Who should read this book?<a href="#who-should-read-this-book" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who should read this book?" title="Direct link to Who should read this book?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Are you feeling stuck? Perhaps it’s a slump at work, in your personal growth, or even in your favorite sport. Slumps are like quicksand—they pull you down slowly unless you fight back. This book is a lifeline for those moments.</p>
<p>Life often goes into autopilot mode, and we shift focus elsewhere, letting critical areas languish. Duckworth’s Grit serves as a wake-up call, a nudge to rekindle that fire and embrace a mindset that champions relentless effort. If you’re searching for a way out of stagnation, this book is for you.</p>

<p>How often do we hear the phrase, “They’re a natural”? Society is obsessed with the idea of talent, often crediting it for someone’s success while ignoring the years of effort behind the scenes. But Duckworth flips the script.</p>
<p>While talent is a good starting point, it’s hardly the full picture. True skill and achievement come from effort. She simplifies this idea with a powerful formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talent × Effort = Skill
Skill × Effort = Achievement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effort counts twice! It turns raw ability into a developed skill and then transforms that skill into real-world results. Duckworth reminds us that even if talent gives someone a head start, consistent effort is what wins the race.</p>

<p>Grit isn’t something you’re born with—it’s something you build. Duckworth identifies three essential ingredients that catalyze grit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interest: You can’t fake passion. To persevere, you need to genuinely enjoy what you’re doing. Finding something that excites you is the first step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purpose: Purpose goes beyond personal ambition. When your goals align with helping others or creating something meaningful, you’re far more likely to persevere. Purpose transforms grit into a mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope: Hope fuels resilience. It’s the belief that setbacks are temporary and challenges are surmountable. Duckworth emphasizes that maintaining optimism during tough times is key to staying the course.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Parenting is pivotal in nurturing grit in children. The environment a child grows up in can either foster resilience or hinder it.</p>
<p>Duckworth advocates for a balanced approach: a combination of high standards (challenging children to push their limits) and unwavering support (providing a safe space to fail and try again). She highlights how early lessons in effort, persistence, and a growth mindset can create gritty adults who thrive under pressure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Duckworth’s message is clear: success isn’t about luck, talent, or shortcuts. It’s about squeezing every ounce of effort from yourself, just as you would a lemon for its juice. Grit is about persevering when adversity strikes, and pushing forward when the path gets steep.</p>
<p>The beauty of Grit lies in its storytelling. Duckworth blends research, anecdotes, and actionable insights in a way that’s easy to read and deeply impactful. This isn’t a lecture—it’s an invitation to transform how you think about success.</p>
<p>So, do you have the grit to pick up this book? If you do, be prepared to see effort, perseverance, and passion in a whole new light. It might just change your life.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/my-reads/18">The 22 Immutable Laws Of Marketing by AI Ries &amp; Jack Trout</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-06-27T15:30:00.000Z">June 27, 2024</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/22-marketing-4eff83c093ce0ff20e598d994f25b663.jpg" width="652" height="1000" class="img_FerL"></p>

<p>As a software engineer, I recognized that despite my proficiency with AI and technology tools, I lacked essential marketing skills. This deficiency was hindering my ability to effectively sell products online. In my quest to bridge this gap, I stumbled upon &quot;The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing&quot; by Al Ries and Jack Trout. This book has been a revelation, offering deep insights into the principles of marketing. Here, I will share three significant concepts from the book for my reference and yours.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="big-ideas">Big Ideas<a href="#big-ideas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Big Ideas" title="Direct link to Big Ideas" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="1-the-law-of-perception">1. The Law of Perception<a href="#1-the-law-of-perception" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. The Law of Perception" title="Direct link to 1. The Law of Perception" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In India, Maruti Suzuki is a household name. However, it is perceived primarily as a mass-market brand, struggling to penetrate the premium segment. To address this, Maruti launched a new brand, Nexa, which has had some success in selling premium cars. Although it has a long way to go to compete with German brands, it is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Similarly, marketing is all about perception. It is not about having the best product but about being perceived as the best. The advertising, taglines, and positioning are all about embedding the brand name in the consumer&#x27;s mind until it becomes the first choice. For example, Pepsi is perceived as youthful, while Coca-Cola is seen as old-school.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may build a great product, but the buyer should perceive you as a great product.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="2-the-law-of-category">2. The Law of Category<a href="#2-the-law-of-category" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. The Law of Category" title="Direct link to 2. The Law of Category" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Maruti produces so many car models even though their prices are often similar? The answer lies in categories. To become a market leader, companies position themselves by creating sub-categories. These sub-categories are further broken down into smaller niches.</p>
<p>Within these small categories, leaders emerge. For instance, Mahindra is the market leader in the SUV segment in India. As a developer, I fall into the sub-category of lead frontend engineers. If you cannot become the number one detergent seller, create a sub-category like liquid detergent and dominate it. This is what Godrej Consumer Care is doing with the liquid detergent market.</p>
<p>A sub category may not fully kill the parent category. For example kindle did not replace books completly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of building a &quot;me-too&quot; product, create a sub-category and be number one in that category.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="3-the-law-of-duality">3. The Law of Duality<a href="#3-the-law-of-duality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. The Law of Duality" title="Direct link to 3. The Law of Duality" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In the long run, every market is dominated by two major players. This phenomenon is inherent in market dynamics. For example, in India, the telecom market, now an essential commodity, is dominated by two giants: Jio and Airtel. The third player, Vodafone, and others continually lose market share to these leaders.</p>
<p>This pattern is evident in various categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Motorcycles: Royal Enfield and KTM</li>
<li>Soda: Coca-Cola and Pepsi</li>
<li>Premium Detergents: Surf Excel and Ariel</li>
<li>Search Engines: Google and Bing</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the market is polarized by two companies, people perceive them as superior and choose them repeatedly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This book has been an eye-opener, helping me understand the marketing dynamics around me. I now comprehend why the Indian telecom market is a duopoly between Jio and Airtel. As a developer, I realize the importance of choosing a sub-category and gaining market share there, rather than competing in the general segment.</p>
<p>While the book is highly informative and offers actionable ideas, it is not a manual that can be implemented in its entirety. It provides a foundation of marketing principles that one can adapt and build upon.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/my-reads/17">Developer experience by Addy Osmani</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-03-04T15:30:00.000Z">March 4, 2024</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Developer experience by Addy Osmani&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/developer-exp-ba6aef2c3f7c4284390b4d9353b1ea24.png" width="1092" height="698" class="img_FerL"></p>

A Life Skill for Everyone by Vishal Gupta</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-23T15:30:00.000Z">October 23, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Learn to Win Arguments and Succeed by Vishal Gupta&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/win-arguments-cbfbbb2a3ff5cf8a8929b7e0483aa2b7.webp" width="400" height="618" class="img_FerL"></p>
<p>Arguments often have a bad reputation, associated with raised voices, negative emotions, and anger. We tend to avoid them, viewing them as something to be steered clear of. After all, arguments are typically reserved for courtrooms and formal debates, right? Well, not quite. Vishal Gupta, an engineer and a criminal side lawyer, believes that mastering the art of argumentation is a life skill that everyone should cultivate. In his book, &quot;Learn to Win Arguments and Succeed,&quot; Gupta sheds light on how to engage in constructive, persuasive arguments that help you convey your viewpoint effectively.</p>
<p>Here are three valuable takeaways from the book that anyone can use to enhance their argumentative skills:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="1-proverbs-less-is-more">1. Proverbs: Less is More<a href="#1-proverbs-less-is-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Proverbs: Less is More" title="Direct link to 1. Proverbs: Less is More" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Proverbs have held a special place in our society for centuries. Instead of using a multitude of words to make your point, proverbs condense wisdom into succinct phrases. Take, for example, the timeless adage, &quot;as you sow, so shall you reap.&quot; This simple proverb can be a powerful tool to persuade someone to take responsibility for their actions. By utilizing such wisdom, you can make your arguments more concise and compelling.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="2-repeat-repeat-repeat">2. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat<a href="#2-repeat-repeat-repeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat" title="Direct link to 2. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Some arguments can be grueling, particularly when the stakes are high. Picture a scenario where someone has damaged your motorcycle and is falsely accusing you of mistakes. Instead of getting lost in the chaos of defending yourself against every accusation, Gupta suggests a different approach: repetition. By consistently and calmly repeating your strong defense, you can guide the conversation toward a resolution. Repetition can help your opponent notice and, ultimately, accept their mistake.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="3-loaded-words-the-power-of-emotion">3. Loaded Words: The Power of Emotion<a href="#3-loaded-words-the-power-of-emotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Loaded Words: The Power of Emotion" title="Direct link to 3. Loaded Words: The Power of Emotion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In the art of persuasion, emotions play a crucial role. Loaded words, as Vishal Gupta explains, are terms or phrases that carry strong emotional connotations. These words are designed to sway opinions, evoke emotions, and manipulate the audience in various ways. For instance, instead of using plain language to accuse someone of their mistake, try employing loaded language to vividly illustrate their error. Words like &quot;injustice&quot; can evoke a profound sense of unfairness, making your argument more emotionally resonant.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Learn to Win Arguments and Succeed&quot; is a must-read for anyone who encounters situations where persuasive skills matter, be it at work, in relationships, or elsewhere. The book offers a comprehensive set of techniques and strategies that can help you emerge victorious in debates while preserving respect and understanding in interpersonal relationships. Vishal Gupta&#x27;s experience as an engineer and a lawyer makes him a credible source to guide readers through the art of argumentation. So, next time you hear someone say, &quot;Don&#x27;t argue with me,&quot; you&#x27;ll be better equipped to navigate the discussion with finesse and persuasion. This book teaches you that arguments can be constructive, and mastering this skill is essential for everyone.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_admI"><a href="/my-reads/15">Making money in stocks - simplified by Aditya Shroff</a></h2><div class="container_kklJ margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-18T15:30:00.000Z">October 18, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Making money in stocks - simplified by Aditya Shroff&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/making-money-simplified-8aa3e8786e049579b6d7f7631ef206ad.jpg" width="326" height="500" class="img_FerL"></p>

<p><strong>Unlocking Creativity and Productivity: Insights from a Comprehensive Study on Focus</strong></p>
<p>In a substantial volume of 368 pages, an author of esteemed journalistic background delves into a subject of paramount significance for individuals of artistic inclinations - the art of focus. This book represents an impressive departure from the author&#x27;s previous works which tackled weighty topics such as drugs, addiction, and depression. Meticulously researched, the book is an eloquent piece of literature that draws its insights from interviews with preeminent experts in the realm of memory management.</p>
<p>Within the pages of this enlightening work, three pivotal concepts stand out, offering readers invaluable insights into the realm of focus and its intricate interplay with various facets of modern life:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="the-symbiotic-dance-between-the-author-and-the-web-a-discourse-on-the-significance-of-flow">The Symbiotic Dance Between the Author and the Web: A Discourse on the Significance of Flow<a href="#the-symbiotic-dance-between-the-author-and-the-web-a-discourse-on-the-significance-of-flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Symbiotic Dance Between the Author and the Web: A Discourse on the Significance of Flow" title="Direct link to The Symbiotic Dance Between the Author and the Web: A Discourse on the Significance of Flow" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The author expounds upon a personal transformation where he purposefully disentangles himself from the ensnaring tendrils of the web, mobile phones, and the internet at large, all in an earnest endeavor to enrich his focus and reclaim moments in a serene coastal town. By relinquishing the constant companionship of his phone and severing the digital umbilical cord, he experiences a profound transformation within himself. However, his epiphany lies in the realization that the absence of digital devices is not the sole catalyst for enhancing focus; rather, it is the pursuit of activities that facilitate a state of flow which emerges as the linchpin for heightened concentration.</p>

<p>As anticipated in a treatise devoted to the reinvigoration of focus, the discourse encompasses a contemplation on the role of applications and technology. The author astutely illuminates the strategies employed by these apps to captivate our attention, laying bare the intricate machinations of a phenomenon dubbed &#x27;surveillance capitalism,&#x27; wherein the behemoths of commerce exploit our online presence to amass considerable fortunes. A countermeasure against this contemporary conundrum is proposed - a judicious utilization of the &#x27;do not disturb&#x27; mode as a means to reclaim our cognitive space.</p>

<p>The author, in his meticulous exploration, unearths an intriguing nexus between dietary habits, environmental factors, and pharmaceutical interventions, particularly as they relate to the burgeoning malady of hyperactivity disorders, notably ADHD. The narrative sheds light on the deleterious consequences of crash diets, elucidating how volatile fluctuations in blood sugar levels engender hyperactivity, ultimately precipitating the manifestation of Attention Disorder and Hyperactivity Disease. A trenchant observation regarding the use of certain additives in soft drinks, recognized culprits in inducing hyperactivity among children, is presented. The dichotomy between the regulatory stances of Europe and the United States on these additives is scrutinized, leaving the reader with much to ponder.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_jRkz" id="concluding-reflections-fostering-a-focus-friendly-society">Concluding Reflections: Fostering a Focus-Friendly Society<a href="#concluding-reflections-fostering-a-focus-friendly-society" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Concluding Reflections: Fostering a Focus-Friendly Society" title="Direct link to Concluding Reflections: Fostering a Focus-Friendly Society" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In synthesis, the book posits focus as an indispensable linchpin in the tapestry of achievement, an attribute transcending individual guilt and transmogrifying into a collective societal responsibility.

<p>My last book talk was on the topic of minimalism at home. As an effect of minimalism, we are going to save money and gain minimalism dividends.</p>
<p>Extending those lines, we are going to discuss another book on the topic of money. It&#x27;s about stock market investing for beginners by Tacho press.</p>
<p>I remember this vividly, ever since I started watching the news on the television. There will be a 1-minute bulletin showing the Bombay stock exchange and just sharing the BSE Sensex numbers and the remaining 25 minutes for news.</p>
<p>I come from a country where financial literacy with technology is not widespread. Most Indians still rely on agents to walk into the door and pitch financial products.</p>
<p>Ask any Indian home about the stock market, they would say that it&#x27;s a sure-shot way to lose money. That&#x27;s because the stock market is not a place where your ambitions are respected, it&#x27;s a place where process, research, and hard work are respected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Losing money on taxes should not be the only reason why you should not sell profitable stocks after many years of holding them.</p>

<p>This book helps you put the leg in the door of the stock market. The book talks at length about three main concepts and a lot of questions for beginners.</p>
<p>The book does not give stock calls or techniques. This book is mostly theoretical and filled with general advice.
Some topics from the fundamental and technical analysis are touched upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 hours of portfolio management per week shows poor time management. Spending less than an hour per week is foolishness.</p>

<p>Frankly speaking, there isn&#x27;t a face behind the book or a page thanking mother/wife, etc. This book is published by a corporate author. That&#x27;s all we know.</p>
<p>This is good in one way because we do not have to emphatize with their anecdotes. We can read the facts and go ahead.</p>

<p>Most young Indians approach the stock market with the mindset of making 1% to 10% percent returns every month. They make a lot of trades and no wonder they make big losses in the first 5 years.</p>
<p>This book does one thing really well. It gives you pointers that act like guard rails so that you can approach the stock market and make money safely. It&#x27;s a recommended read even for intermediate-level stock market professionals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stock market beginner should not do a lot of trades.</p>
